<p>I have seen more people in wheelchairs going about town and doing things in public over 2 months in Finland than during my entire life in Russia.</p>
<p>But sure, state support and mandatory accessibility laws are evil collectivist tyranny and we should scrap it and patiently await private charity to do things like add ramps to most buildings. Because that’s totally what happens in the absense of state intervention.</p>

<p>Dude, you might want to notice that the thing that got you on this thread was a bunch of people, including <i>evil libertarians</i>, were upset that they weren’t going to be allowed to give educational materials away for free anymore. Instead those materials (lectures, notes, etc) will continue to be gated behind 50-200k paywalls.</p>

<p>Wait, what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The federal Department of Justice recently informed the university that the online content it makes available to the public free of charge runs afoul of the Americans with Disabilities Act—blind and deaf people wouldn’t be able to access it, according to the government.</p>
<p>In response, Berkeley is considering simply removing the online resources, since that’s much cheaper than becoming ADA compliant.</p>
<p>You might say, well, Berkeley is a public university, and has a responsibility to make its resources available to all students, regardless of their disability status. That’s true. But here’s the thing: no Berkeley student has complained. The online courses have proven to be perfectly accessible to the entire student body thus far.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/09/13/a-statement-on-online-course-content-and-accessibility/">DOJ’s memo</a>, the two complainants are both members of the National Association for the Deaf. They work for Gallaudet University, a school for the deaf in Washington, DC. They have nothing to do with Berkeley. They tried to watch some of the videos Berkeley posted online, but found that they were unable to comprehend them.</p>
<p>If Berkeley had not made its online courses free and public, it would not have invited this complaint. But since anyone is allowed to watch the university’s online lectures and videos, the fact that some of them aren’t captioned—and are thus inaccessible to the hearing-disabled community—is a problem, as far as the law is concerned.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the DOJ—fulfilling its role here as the Handicapper General—for ensuring equal access to public education, where “equal access” is defined as “no access for anybody.”</p>

<p>This seems like it would be better solved with auto-transcription software or the like. </p>

<p>That was in that case, even before the letter (in the form of Google’s transcription software embedded in youtube). But was found to be insufficient, as it is very error prone for lectures on technical topics with complicated word use.  </p><p>But that case isn’t terribly relevant to what <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mprin8jzFx6ntBQub_NYwvA">@multiheaded1793</a> was talking about.  multi was talking about how the physical infrastructure for disabled people was much better in Finland than in Russia, with clear reference to physical infrastructure like wheelchair ramps.</p>
