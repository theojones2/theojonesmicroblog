<p>So it looks like every single finnish C-tribe progressive decided to go full Orwell and now they’re campaigning to <b>literally ban</b> every single organization that matches a frighteningly broad definition of “racism”.</p>
<p>Ban, as in, “even giving legal advice to such organizations is a crime”, as in, “literally the same treatment organized crime gets”.</p>
<p>Frighteningly broad, as in, “I know PoC whose opinions, on things they presumably know far more about than random finnish whites, would make them liable for bannings if they were organized about it”.</p>
<p>Combined, this means “if those PoC made a think tank discussing their somewhat controversial views the law would treat them exactly the same as the mafia”. I’m not even kidding.</p>
<p>Looks like I’m not going to get any progress on SICP today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahh, the progressive utopia that is Scandinavia. How on earth *can* you ban giving legal advice, what the heck?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does anyone have a link to a news article (preferably English language) about this? I’ve been searching Google News for “finland racism law” but haven’t been turning anything up.</p>

<p>Translations are terrible as usual because Finnish is a weird-ass language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Civil liberties must not be used to restrict other civil liberties groups, Black Rock says.” I don’t fully understand this sentence but I think I dislike it. (It appears in the second document as well: “This will also send a clear message that civil liberties can not be used to restrict other civil liberties groups.”)</p>

<p>“The European Court of Human Rights outlines of the freedom of assembly does not extend to racist mobilisations.”</p>

<p>In the example law thing (second document, near the bottom, line breaks added by me):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Promotion of Racial Discrimination. Anyone who participates in any activity or other organization organized to promote or incite racial discrimination to be sentenced for the promotion of racial discrimination to a fine or imprisonment for up to two years. Participation is considered</p>
  
  <p>1) the establishment or organization of promoting racial discrimination organization or group;<br />
  or 2) the collection or provision of racial discrimination in activities that encourage funds;<br />
  or 3) a very important economic or legal advice to the racial discrimination to the work of the operation;<br />
  or 4) Promotion of Racial Discrimination otherwise materially actively promoting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume the autotranslation of item 3 is bad enough that “Your Honor [or whatever the Finnish title is], I did give the HBD Blogging Association legal advice, and it may even have been useful, but it wasn’t <em>very</em> important, just kind of important” is not actually a valid defense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, the defense is valid if you can convince them that your advice to the HBD Blogging Association was genuinely not “very important” (where it gets Fun is whether giving advice on what stays within the boundaries of this law is considered “very important”) <i>and yes that’s exactly as horrible as it sounds</i>.</p>

<p>The correct translation is “civil rights may not be used to restrict the civil rights of other groups” (groups as in PoC, women, religious minorities etc.) and while the idea is sound, “your right to swing your fist stops where my nose begins” and all, the proposed law is <i>a total non-sequitur</i>.</p>

<p>For the sake of clarity, here’s my cleaned-up translations of the four illegal activities:</p>

<p>1. Organizing, or participating in, groups promoting racial discrimination</p>

<p>2. Collecting funds for, or giving funds to, groups promoting racial discrimination</p>

<p>3. Giving very important legal or economic advice to groups promoting racial discrimination</p>

<p>4. Otherwise actively and substantially promoting racial discrimination</p>

<p>And the law on NGOs would add that it’s illegal for an NGO to promote or incite racial discrimination, and existing such organizations would be banned.</p>

<p>Is this proposal … popular?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This afternoon (local time, 8 hours ago) it had been signed by around 3500 people (in a couple of days) which is approximately 0.06% of the population or the per capita equivalent of 210 000 americans. Citizens’ initiatives gathering 50 000 signatures in 6 months must be voted by the parliament (this isn’t one, but it’s a suitable comparison) and the initiative for marriage equality gathered a record-holding 130 000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like some of the issue is that your number of signatures required for an initiative is crazy low. Too low to filter out garbage bills.  (Fortunately, that isn’t yet an initiative) In most U.S states <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Laws_governing_the_initiative_process_in_Arizona#Number_required">it’s a few times th</a>at.  </p>
