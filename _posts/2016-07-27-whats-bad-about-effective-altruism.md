<blockquote><p>the entire idea of “what should i do with my life to provide the maximum marginal utility to society” is very un-empirical and reliant on speculation and counterfactual reasoning and there’s this weird paternalistic, Eurocentric attitude running through it all. it just seems like its proponents are trying to portray themselves as perfectly rational, dispassionate moral beings without actually examining their white, western ideological underpinnings. in short: 100% ideology, 0% materialism</p></blockquote>
<p>Um. I’m not sure where you got that impression?</p>
<p>From what I’ve seen about effective altruism, it is all about providing people with <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">mosquito netting</a> to help prevent the spread of malaria, and provide a real test of <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/04/14/universal_basic_income_this_nonprofit_is_about_to_test_it_in_a_big_way.html">universal basic income</a> in Kenya.</p>
<p>Also, how on earth is effective altruism “un-empirical”? Literally the entire point of effective altruism is finding the most <i>effective</i> method of being <i>altruistic</i>. And from what I’ve seen, people take that <a href="http://www.givewell.org/about/givewell-overview">very seriously</a>.</p>
<p>How is it imperialistic to help people not catch infectious diseases and offer them money with literally no strings attached?  Tbh that sounds like the opposite of imperialism. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you not see that being the one to provide all the life-saving resources puts you in a position of power over the oppressed, though? It makes them depend on you for their short-term survival - that’s inherently imperialistic when it’s rich Westerners exerting influence over poor people in other countries. Better to dismantle oppressive international power structures than put yourself at the top cause you think you know what’s best for everyone.</p>

<p>

“Can you not see that being the one to provide all the life-saving resources puts you in a position of power over the oppressed, though?”

<br /></p>
<p>Even if that is true, are you saying that you’d rather impoverished people <i>literally die</i> than have anyone have any kind of power over them? Because that’s fucked up.</p>
<p>If we can prove that universal basic income works, then we can potentially get it in more places around the world, including various first world nations to help out their struggling populace.</p>
<p>The idea is not to make them dependent on the money. The idea is to give them enough so they are not <i>constantly struggling.</i> </p>
<p>Also: how does not getting malaria make you dependent on anyone?</p>
<p>And how is providing people with money “acting like you know what’s best” for them? You know what’s acting like you know what’s best for people? Basically every single US government welfare service. Food stamps is a good example; you can only purchase very specific things with food stamps because the government doesn’t want to you “”””waste”””” the money on things that they don’t think you need.</p>
<p>Decreasing suffering is a good thing.</p>

<p>Effective Altruism is one of those topics that really illustrates how many people would much rather be Don Quixote than Norman Borlaug. They want to feel heroic and noble and so they tell themselves a story about giants to slay. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Giving out malaria nets is bad because you should “dismantle oppressive international power structures
“ instead. <br /></p>
<p>I seriously thought that response was parody of how selfish and myopic ultra-leftists were, until I saw it being defended further in less pithy ways.</p>
<p>Here is why we say we should alleviate suffering instead of devoting our efforts to “

dismantle oppressive international power structures”

</p>
<p>- You cannot identify what they are. You don’t even know what they look like. Your system of analyzing where and what oppressive power structures are is fundamentally and irrevocably broken.</p>
<p>- You do not understand how to dismantle them. You have no idea what they get power from or why they do what they do. In place of this information, you make things up that are emotionally satisfying and make you feel Maximally Revolutionary. </p>
<p>- You have no idea what to replace them with. You don’t know what they do or why, so of course you have no clue what you ought to make to replace them. Because your understanding of “oppressive power structures” is so unthinking and juvenile, you continually identify “this solves a problem in a not-perfectly-optimal way” as “this is oppressive” and will then continually destroy things that people need in order to solve problems, and replace them with nothing whatsoever.</p>
<p>You’re telling us we’re bad people for focusing on things that work and are proven to work, because instead, we should focus on doing things that have never been proven to work, have been proven not to work, are based on the theories of people who are never ever ever ever ever ever ever right, interpreted through the observation and analysis of other people who are never ever ever ever ever ever ever right. </p>
<p>You’d have us steal everyone’s umbrellas because you think they oppress people into standing beneath them, because your analysis is so Godawful it can’t understand that rain is falling. You’d have us burn every ladder in the world because it’s not fair that people can’t fly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also, knowing that power structures need to be reformed tell you little about what you personally should do. Note that the reform to the power structures <i>isn’t happening</i>. In the current system donating money can do a lot of good. </p>
<p>And the power disparities here come from having more wealth. Its better that people use that power/wealth responsibly than irresponsibly.  Would you rather that Bill Gates spend his money on mansions and yachts instead of donating to charity?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, but that’s not the real tradeoff he faces. It’d probably be better for the world in the long term if he invested that money in a productive enterprise rather than throwing it down a bottomless well of misery to be consumed. And better for him personally, as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed that there is a lot to say for the Elon Musk option (investing in a speculative, but high social value company). But the people who are against EA because something something oppressive power structures probably wouldn&rsquo;t like that either.  </p>
