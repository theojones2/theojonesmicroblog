<p><strike>They had me at “beware male feminists” and lost me at “beware men who value objectivity over subjectivity

”. </strike></p>
<p>Seriously speaking tho, the lack of self-awareness in that article…</p>
<p><i>&gt;

Beware men who use examples of their oppressed intersections to invalidate your arguments.

</i></p>
<p>when just before it said:</p>
<p><i>&gt;

Beware men whose first words when you relate your lived experience are “well, actually” or “not all.”

</i></p>
<p>and afterwards it also says:</p>
<p><i>&gt; 

Beware men who swear up and down that “this isn’t about that,” when the “that” is a marginalized identity that you hold.

</i></p>
<p>So… if a man talks about about their experiences as an oppressed person and you disagree… he’s the bad one.</p>
<p>But if you talk about how your experience as an oppressed person and they disagree… he’s <i>still</i> the bad one.</p>

<p>Hoo boy. Also “men who demand to be present in your queer spaces” are we supposed to just know they only mean cishet men? Or are all dudes considered not queer??</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair it says in *your* queer spaces so maybe it specifically means lesbian/female only spaces? Which is a valid point if that’s the case</p>

<p>Yeah. <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mm8SqQZZTIjDAoQYstl4IOA">@lvxiuwendono</a> correctly pointed out that most of the really bad ones here come from mental shortcuts. They‘re <i>trying</i> to get at something more nuanced, and sometimes I can even see what they’re going for, but what’s actually written ends up being horrifying. <br /></p>

<p>I’m not sure of that. What is written is probably close to how they conceive of the issues internally, in a way that leaks into their opinions on other issues. As written it’s absurd enough that they would fall back to the nuanced opinion if pressed.  But that’s not how they think of these issues.</p>
