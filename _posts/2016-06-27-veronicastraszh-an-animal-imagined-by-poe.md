<p>I’ve been talking with <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/my7VgJNsgUD4XOn6rNg_jgg">@theunitofcaring</a>, who’s definitely still alive and feels bad about disappearing. She wants me to say that she’s been in and out of the hospital with health issues from anorexia, has a plan to get better, and appreciates everyone’s concern but isn’t in state to reliably answer messages. We talk pretty much every day, and if you have anything to tell her it’s best to direct it through me. </p>

<p>Please send her loving thoughts from all of us.</p>
