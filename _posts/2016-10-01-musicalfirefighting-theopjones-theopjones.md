<p>We’re confident that our viewers think this law is utterly preposterous but just in case you’re a total scuz bag, The Daily Show made an effort to demonstrate how silly it truly is.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yah, I didn’t like that segment either. The Daily Show style on that was not useful in explaining anything about what the legislation actually does or the issues around it.</p>
<p>I’m pretty much against these laws, particularly this one that does focus on eliminating municipal anti-discrimination ordinances. I haven’t really looked into the particulars of the bit of legislation that the Daily Show was talking about, so, hopefully I won’t blast myself in the foot. But it doesn’t look good.  And it also looks like there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Facilities_Privacy_%26_Security_Act">a lot more in that law</a> than the public accommodations section, and some of those parts are quite troubling on first glance. </p>
<p>But, when you look at things like the Indiana RFRA that has been back in the news (due to Mike Pence)  there is a weird incoherence in the views of the left on RFRAs. In some cases they support (ie. the RFRA on the federal level that passed with strong Dem support) legislation that is almost functionally identical to the bills that they oppose (the state level RFRAs). But it feels like a lot of people are deciding their opinions on who is proposing the bill, not the substantive content of it. It has in effect a proxy battle for political tribalism. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, I think there is a  big <a href="http://www.reconsidermedia.com/something-to-consider/the-parties-who-cried-wolf">party that cried wolf</a> issue here. With the Indiana RFRA, there were credible policy arguments in favor of it (although, yes, bad intentions among the proposers, and yes arguments that I agree with opposing it), but opponents pulled out all the stops to oppose it.</p>
<p>With the HB2 bill (the one the Daily Show was talking about) it was pretty clearly terrible legislation. The aggressive response to previous bills discredited those arguments, even when a much worse bill that deserved that response came into existence. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to be clear, I’m not saying that bill was good. I didn’t look at it, and from the blurb it looked like an overreaction.</p>
<p>Just that if you think basically all your viewers agree with you, that is precisely when you don’t need to be making fun of everyone who disagrees.</p>

<p>I didn’t mean to imply an opinion on your part. </p><p>I was just saying that some of the Daily Show type arguments on this subject are counterproductive/contradictory. </p>
