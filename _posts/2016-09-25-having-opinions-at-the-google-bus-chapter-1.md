<blockquote>
<p>As the new trading 
economy grew, however, all this began to change. With many former 
peasants going into business for themselves, the aristocracy lost its 
monopoly over value creation. The people’s economy was growing while the
 aristocracy’s remained stagnant or even shrank. The nobles had no way 
to keep up. They looked at this new phenomenon of growth and wanted some
 of it for themselves. They got their growth, but through
 forced and artificial means. Where the growth of the peasant economy 
could be considered natural, or even appropriate, the aristocracy’s 
efforts to usurp it were less so. It’s one thing for growth to help 
peasants achieve subsistence. It’s another for those who already own 
pretty much everything to use growth purely as a means to prevent 
others’ enrichment. But that’s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>The nobles still had the
 power to write the law, and in a series of moves that took place in 
different countries at different times, they taxed the bazaar, broke up 
the guilds, outlawed local currencies, and bestowed monopoly charters on
 their favorite merchants. In exchange for stock, kings granted certain 
companies exclusive control over their industries. The peer-to-peer, or 
“P2P,” nature of the economy changed—not overnight, but over a couple of
 centuries—to the top-down economy we know today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds simplified but okay.</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of making and 
trading, craftspeople had to seek employment from one of the chartered 
monopolies. Instead of selling their wares, people now sold their hours.
 Counterintuitively, perhaps, business owners learned to seek out the 
least qualified workers. A skilled shoemaker might demand pay befitting 
his expertise. An immigrant seeking day labor could be gotten on the 
cheap and was easily replaced by another if he protested his hours, 
conditions, or compensation. But how could a bunch of unskilled workers 
create a viable product? Welcome to the industrial age.</p></blockquote>
<p>A darker interpretation would be that the guild system had actually systematically denied that immigrant’s access to those jobs and when it was busted work couldn’t be cartellized like that anymore and of course when you let poor peasants compete with comfortable cartels the cartelmembers lose out; but carry on, because this isn’t strictly speaking false either.<br /></p>
<blockquote><p>What we now call 
industrialization was actually an extension of the aristocracy’s effort 
to usurp the growth it witnessed in the peasants’ marketplace and to 
imitate it by other means. Industry was really just the development of 
manufacturing processes that required less skill from human laborers. 
Instead of having to learn how to make shoes, each worker could be 
trained in minutes to do one tiny part of the job. In the long run, many
 industrial processes have ended up more efficient than production by 
individual craftspeople, but that’s most often because their total costs
 are hidden or externalized to others. (The government pays for wars to 
procure cheap oil and roads to convey mass-produced products, while we 
all pay for the environmental stresses caused by corporate agriculture, 
and so on.) Prices may be low, but the costs are high. It was never really about efficiency
 anyway; industrialization was about restoring the power of those at the
 top by minimizing the value and price of human laborers. This became 
the embedded value system of industrialism, and we see it in every 
aspect of the commercial landscape, then and now.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then there’s stuff about rendering labor invisible, removing the human elements with branding etc.</p>
<p>Then there’s a comparison of “artisanal” and “industrial” production which has all kinds of cute and not-really-incorrect comparisons on how the “artisanal” is (implicitly) better. It just ignores the one really big difference: a printed book is <i>way way way cheaper than a manuscript</i>, not just impersonal and branded etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ll <a></a>trace
 each of these developments more fully, but for now what’s important to 
notice is that each industrial innovation diminished the value of one 
human element after another. Identifiably crafted products, such as the 
manuscript, gave way to mechanically reproducible ones, such as the 
printed book. Instead of relating to products through the human who made
 them, people relate to the brand on the package, and so on. People are 
disconnected from the value chain. This was by design, even if the 
intentions behind that design have been submerged and forgotten. 
Remember, industrialism’s primary intent was to subvert a rising middle 
class and their peer-to-peer market system. Merchants and craftspeople 
were creating value from the bottom up and threatening the passively 
earned income of the aristocracy. The object of the game was to get 
people out of the way, because they create value independently, demand 
compensation, and value their relationships over their purchases. And 
the game remains the same to this day.</p>
<p>Removing the human hand 
from industry has its obvious advantages, some of which benefit everyone
 in the long run. We should be grateful for the printed book for easing 
the spread of knowledge and ideas, even if its happy invention was part 
of a larger, less beneficent drive toward mechanization. Industrial 
processes often let us reap more, produce faster, and distribute more 
widely. But they do all this from a rather flawed starting place, which 
is why they are now reaching a point of diminishing returns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay at least the text addresses it.</p>
<p>Then there’s stuff about “winner takes it all” mechanics and long tails.</p>
<blockquote><p>As if responding to this obvious critique of his Long Tail theory, Chris Anderson followed up with a book called Free,
 arguing that we should all give away our labor and products. In his 
view, creative professionals in particular should welcome the 
opportunity to give away their books, music, and other products because 
they build up demand for other services such as live performances and 
lectures. “Those $20k speaker fees soon add up,”<a href="///home/user/Desktop/Douglas%20Rushkoff-Throwing%20Rocks%20at%20the%20Google%20Bus_%20How%20Growth%20Became%20the%20Enemy%20of%20Prosperity-Portfolio%20%282016%29/text/part0012.html#en0026en"><sup>21</sup></a>
 he explains. Of course, the only venues capable of paying those fees 
are corporations looking for speakers to validate their practices and 
reinforce the cycle of dehumanization—not schools and communities 
seeking help in resisting those forces.</p></blockquote>
<p>This part feels like someone didn’t think things through. Just before Rushkoff had decried the “extraction of value” of industrialism compared to the “creation of value” of the artisanal economy. But giving books away, or specifically <i>not threatening violence</i> against those who either give away their copies, or add their labor to their copies to produce better copies and then give away those, is the value-creating move while threatening violence is the extractive one. Of course, our current dysfunctional IP hellscape has no alternatives between giving stuff away and threatening violence. But anyway, I wasn’t going to pay Rushkoff $30 for a book I didn’t know anything about the quality of, so I just had to spend my time searching until I found a library which had it, when I could’ve gotten it just from his homepage like in a civilized society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, Amanda Palmer, a musician with a small but ardent 
following, found herself without a record label after the company 
realized she was only selling about 25,000 albums—a paltry amount by 
industry standards. So she turned to the crowdfunding site Kickstarter, 
hoping to raise $100,000 from her fan base to make another record. She 
ended up raising $1.2 million, from a total of just 24,800 people.</p>
<p>(…)<br /></p>
<p>Interestingly enough,
 although her own fans love and support her, Palmer has been quite 
vociferously attacked by those who don’t approve of her tactics. They 
argue that after receiving financial support from her fans, she should 
be excluded from participating in the sorts of barter and gift 
relationships she still enjoys on the road. How dare she enjoy the 
fruits of a “gift economy” of collaborators, meals, and lodgings while 
also asking for money for her own labor? And she’s just one of many such
 artists accused of hypocrisy, in the screechy tones of heightened 
outrage that only the dehumanized anonymity of the Internet seems 
capable of generating.</p>
<p>This “hybrid” approach 
to making culture may be messy, but it’s upsetting only when we look at 
it through the industrial lens of big corporations exploiting humans. As
 a business plan, it’s inconsistent. But Amanda Palmer is not some 
monopoly company, or even a superstar performer exploiting her fans; 
she’s one midlist singer trying to make a living in a winner-takes-all 
landscape intentionally designed to prevent her from forging real 
relationships or exchanging value with her listeners. Her mix of barter,
 money, and gift is actually much more compatible with the tangled, 
ambiguous nature of real human relationships and hearkens back to the 
best qualities of the preindustrial economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that I basically actually agree on. Liberate the economy, don’t shackle it into antiquated notions of commercial vs. non-commercial (that usually are also classist, as only people of sufficient material security can extensively participate in stuff where anything resembling commercial exchange is verboten).</p>
<blockquote><p>there used to be an Internet that ran entirely on “shareware,”</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it means what you think it means. Shareware was stuff where you could access a part of something but then had to pay.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>THE UNEMPLOYMENT SOLUTION</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Okay sounds like the “good” stuff…</p>
<blockquote><p>The seemingly endless “jobless recovery” makes no sense at all, 
particularly at a time when many of us are working longer hours as 
overextended freelancers or the nominally unemployed than we did when we
 had real jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>No it doesn’t. Such a thing is theoretically impossible. Sounds like ~the government~ is involved. It’s the only explanation that makes sense; <i>something</i> has fucked up the economy so terribly and it’s probably the bunch of violent people whose <i>job description</i> is to fuck with the economy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our industrial 
capabilities have surpassed our requirements. We make more stuff than we
 can use, at least here in the developed world. Even middle-class 
Americans rent storage units for their extra stuff. Our banks are 
tearing down foreclosed homes in multiple U.S. states in order to 
prevent market values from declining. Our Department of Agriculture is storing, even burning, surplus crops to stabilize prices for industrial agriculture. There is more than enough to go around. Why don’t we give those houses to the homeless, or that food to the hungry?</p>
<p>Because they don’t have jobs. Letting them just have stuff does not contribute to the great growth imperative.</p>
<p>Instead, we’re supposed 
to think of new, useless things for these folks to make, then market 
those things to the rest of us, so that we go buy them, dispose of them,
 and then create more landfill. All in the name of growth. It’s as if we
 expect consumers to fuel the production of unnecessary goods just so 
that people can put in more hours of work they’d rather not be doing. 
We’re not looking to create jobs because we need more things. We employ 
people because otherwise we have no way to justify letting them share in
 a bounty created without their labor.</p>
<p>To most of us, this is 
just “the way things are,” and to question the arrangement goes against 
centuries of precedent. Fortunately, all the reasons against overturning
 the scheme are based solely on the growth requirements of the 
industrial economic operating system—not on reality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I 50% agree with this, 50% think it’s a scary dog-whistle for “moar government”, and 50% think it’s fundamentally mistaken because the “economic operating system” actually<i> is</i> fucked up and should be replaced with something not-upfucked, and 50% am just fucking with the numbers to symbolize the fucked-up nature of this economy where increases in productivity don’t translate to proportionate increases in prosperity and involuntary unemployment is able to exist.</p>
<blockquote><p>A surplus of productivity should not be a problem. It’s only troublesome
 in an economy in which markets are driven by scarcity alone and value 
is understood as something to be extracted from people rather than 
created for them. That’s the zero-sum economic approach that sees 
something like, say, renewable energy as such a problem: how do we 
compensate for the loss of profit to be derived from digging oil out of 
the ground?</p></blockquote>
<p>I 50% despair for the person who thinks free markets would find the last sentence meaningful, and 50% despair for the society where “markets” have turned to mean something which <i>does</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlike a guaranteed minimum income, “guaranteed minimum-wage public 
jobs” can actually redirect human effort toward the areas that need 
attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>I 50% “ewww, how about <i><b>nope</b></i>” and 50% “nope, <i>giving people currency and letting them spend it is how you </i>[LET THEM!!!! this is IMPORTANT!!! you are not smarter than everyone else on their own needs!!!]<i> redirect that human effort</i>”.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonindustrial practices may be more labor-intensive, but they’re also better for us all. For those of us used to white-collar jobs, the idea of growing 
vegetables or making clothes may seem like a big step backward toward 
more menial labor. But consider for a moment the sorts of activities the wealthiest 
Americans or most satisfied retirees engage in enthusiastically: brewing
 craft beers, knitting, and gardening. If there’s really not enough work to go around and there are so many extra people to employ, we can always farm in shifts.</p></blockquote>
<p>On government money? I 150% “ewww, how about <b><i>nope</i></b>”. I think this was tried in countries which today have “genocide museums”.</p>
<p>Also a big appeal of these things is probably precisely their voluntary and incorrupted nature, because the government isn’t fucking shit up and forcing people to do them.</p>
<blockquote><p>We can make a whole lot less stuff—or even stop making more stuff—and 
still not end up waiting in 1970s’ Soviet-style lines for toothpaste. 
Adopting policies aimed not at increasing employment but at actively decreasing it means challenging the assumption that the economy has to keep growing at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>I 100% ran out of percentages to “ewww, how about <b><i>nope</i></b>” with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This would be a tough 
sell in a Congress that can’t even agree to pay for last year’s budget 
obligations, much less understand the difference between a debt ceiling 
and an operating deficit. Luckily, unlike Renaissance monarchs who 
depended on their exclusive power over lawmaking to rewrite the rules of
 commerce in their favor, we live in a digital landscape in which rules 
can be rewritten from the outside in. The industrial age may have been 
all about one-size-fits-all solutions, but the digital age will be about
 a wide range of distributed ones.</p>
<p>That’s why we have to 
look at what we can do as business owners, investors, bankers, and 
individuals to program an economic operating system that works for 
people instead of against them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay you convinced me that congressional inability to act is a good thing, congratulations.</p>
<p>Now stay tuned for the next part where we presumably <i>don’t</i> get to use the Khmer Rouge solution and thus might actually figure out something useful and non-violent for dealing with the fucked up shit.<br /></p>

<p>this book brings <i>so</i> many different new experiences to all kinds of people :3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are though. The “”solutions“” they suggest reveal a profound lack of experience with the bad outcomes that will happen. I don’t know the author, but reading your excerpt makes me believe: The author has never been on, or knows somebody who has been on, the receiving end of state violence. Has never had to work manual labor or starve. Has never worked manual labor voluntarily. Has no feeling for how the state bureaucracy treats those who rely on it for their daily survival, and has no idea, no conception of how destructive state-enforced irrelevant make-work is to the psyche</p>
<p>And then on top of that, there are also the other ignorances that are not borne of privilege - like the belief that moving away from mass production and back to hand crafting will somehow make things better. That is such a profoundly middle-class attitude. It is also classist as fuck - “My kind of people can afford to buy ‘local’ and ‘sustainable’ and &lsquo;artisinal’ so you should too because it is clearly the good choice or my class of people wouldn’t do it” yeah maybe other people don’t buy Artisinal because it costs ten times as much and they’re too busy paying rent. Maybe “ten factory workers together can produce as much as a thousand traditional craftsmen” is in fact an incredible source of wealth that allows people to purchase goods without worrying?</p>

<p>This is a member of the genera of left-wing discussion of agriculture that thinks that farm == bucolic pasture, and that has close to zero actual knowledge of how agriculture works. Really, I’m close to the opinion that if you haven’t worked in the agricultural sector or something adjacent to it, you should STFU about it because a lot of people are wildly ignorant about that subject. </p>
