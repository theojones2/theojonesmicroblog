<p>this is vulnerable to critique of what happens when marginalised people vote for something stupidly counterproductive.</p>

<p>More so than when any other group of people vote for something stupidly counterproductive?
<a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mOLVB1t-W1BaoD6UM8wVlNQ">@tooth-and-nails</a> is there any system where marginalized people don’t get screwed over?</p>

<p>This is a case where I would say that a system should be judged based on the incentives it creates for leaders. And, even though the electoral process will sometimes generate policies that are bad for marginalized people, democracy tends to still create good incentives in their regard. Because politicians need to get a majority of the vote and if they damage a group too much, than they will lose that portion of the vote. It’s not perfect, and there are some areas of policy that should still be removed from populist electoral pressures. But its pretty good. </p>
