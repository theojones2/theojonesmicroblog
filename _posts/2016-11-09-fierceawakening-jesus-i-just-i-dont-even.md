<blockquote>
<p>Jesus.</p>

<p>I just. I don’t even know.</p>

<p>This is probably going to sound weird and not make anyone feel better but like… I just keep wishing there had been some way to reach out to that groundswell of people, to let them know they DIDN’T have to feel hated and be afraid</p>

<p>Because the only way something like this happens is when people feel hated and are afraid</p>

<p>I feel… this is probably really, really weird to read and I’m sorry it’s not comforting at all, but honestly I feel like this thing where we write people off as terrible and never listen to them… it makes them do things like this.</p>

<p>Agreed. </p><p>Although, I’m worried that the left will get the inverse message from tonight and double down the behaviour that resulted in this, such as the hostility towards rural working class people and tendency to ignore class in forming policies. And therefore add gas to this dumpster fire.  </p>
