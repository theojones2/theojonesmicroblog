<p>Is “slippery slope” always a fallacy though? I’ve been wondering this for a while.</p>

<p>Because it seems to me there’s a difference between “if the Patriot Act is signed, then it will likely normalize surveillance, and that normalizing will further erode privacy rights in the US” and “if the Patriot Act is signed, nosy government agents will come to take us away and within a generation, dystopia will be upon us.”</p>

<p>I think it’s important to remind people not to make broad leaps, but I worry about suggesting that we should never mention concerns about seemingly small changes emboldening extremists.</p>

<p>I think that, if you have a slope that’s actually slippery, it’s almost certainly a very level slope. If the slope were really that steep, most people would probably recognize it, and it wouldn’t be widely considered a reasonable idea. It’s still a slope, but not one we’ll go careening down.</p>
<p>As a rule, if your argument is on the order of “gay marriage will lead to bestiality” I’m probably not going to take you seriously. If it’s on the order of “easing up on policing marijuana users will contribute to the idea that marijuana is a minor drug, and could lead to further decriminalization/legalization in the future” im going to take you — ok not necessarily seriously, but I probably won’t be reflexively dismissive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then there’s also the thing where people do try to change things incrementally, especially in policy. Witness how hard it often is for women in many states to get abortions. This is widely considered not to be a static thing – oh, she has to cross a state line to find a clinic, and look at ultrasounds, and do this, this, and this, we’re good! No, the end goal is usually assumed to be overturning Roe.</p>
<p>Or take some of the conversations on this blog about gun control. I said I wondered if a few more restrictive measures were really the end of the world, and people immediately said “the thing is, this has never just been about background checks before. It’s always been about one law leading to another, and eventually our rights will be severely restricted. I might trust you to stop, Fierce, but I don’t trust the lawmakers your support would embolden. I think those people ACTUALLY DO think the second amendment was ‘only for militias,’ and therefore will keep going. I worry about my rights.”</p>
<p>I’m inclined to think that second thing might well BE a slippery slope, of the sort I find illegitimate. But I’m wondering whether it can be dismissed outright as nuttery, or if sometimes people notice patterns because they’re actually there.</p>
<p>Sometimes people *really do* have Goal F, and plan to do, in order, A, B, C, D, and E so they can make F happen. </p>

<p>Or… well, yes some homophobes said “if we legalize gay marriage, people will marry their dogs!” This was silly, because 1) most humans are not sexually attracted to dogs, and more importantly 2) sex between a human and a dog is rape, and it takes a special kind of horrible person to want to legalize rape.</p>
<p>But some homophobes said “if we legalize gay marriage, then these weird pol-lee-am-er-ists will say hey why can’t I marry more than one person at the same time? We all love one another and we all consent!”</p>
<p>And the idea that society getting used to marriage being about personal choice might lead to that is a lot harder to argue against. (I don’t think you SHOULD argue against it, but that’s beside the point I’m making.)</p>
<p>There are reasons it might not *happen*, including nuances of tax law. </p>
<p>But it’s a lot harder to dismiss someone who says “fight for traditional marriage if the thought of three people marrying each other scares you, because that’s the next debate we will be having!” than it is to dismiss someone who says “if you’re not okay with dog rapers, vote yes on prop 8.”</p>

<p>I agree with you here. I think there are generally three types of potentially valid slippery slope type arguments</p><ol><li><b>The nibbling at the edge issue</b>. If there are two politically powerful groups at the extremes of an issue, you can get a situation where, due to the existence of moderates and institutional constraints, neither side can win outright, but one of the extremes can incrementally advance through small advances due to the ability to carve out groups of moderates and also due to the ability to paint the other side as unwilling to compromise. Eventually, the small victories will add up to something that starts to look at lot like total victory. The abortion slippery slope argument is pretty much this. </li><li><b>The shelling point issue</b>. On some issues, there is reason to believe that the government will consistently make sub-optimal issues. This can be dealt with by creating a strong taboo/institutional constraints against legislating on these issues, but, if those constraints are weakened then the floodgates will open. This is pretty much the slippery slope argument about privacy.</li><li><b>The overton window shifting issue</b>. The proponents of $policy have values that, if applied consistently, would suggest a much broader change in policy. Due to status-quo bias they aren’t yet advocating this, but the range of policy discussion will gradually shift in that direction, This is pretty much the slippery slope argument regarding gay marriage/poly marriage. </li></ol><p>The gun control slippery slope argument is a mix of the three argument types. </p>
