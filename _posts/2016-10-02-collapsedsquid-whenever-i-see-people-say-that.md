<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I see people say that libertarian systems won’t have segregation because market efficiency, I’m deeply skeptical.</p>
<p>Part of my skepticism is that libertarian is fairly right-wing in practice, and I don’t associate right-wing governments with race-neutral policies. I tend to extend this into “I expect libertarian societies to lean heavily on racism to maintain their power.“  <br /></p>
<p>And it make sense, property rights don’t enforce themselves and that sort of thing can help.  It’s just the most economical way to enforce property rights is to have a group who you guarantee a secure position and respect to push around others.  It just makes economic sense.</p>
<p>There’s also the labor market segmentation aspect.  You have multiple groups of people who aren’t competing for the same jobs, the race that’s lower on the totem pole can be paid less if you don’t have to worry about them leaving for higher-wage work because that’s excluded from them. <br /></p>
<p>So, in a modern society with a state, the rich may rely on their managing committee to do this.  Assuming they won’t immediately re-build the state, I think the rich will find another way to do this.  It’s just good business sense.  <br /></p>
