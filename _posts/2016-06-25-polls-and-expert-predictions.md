<p>Both with the Brexit vote and with the effectiveness of Trump in the presidential primary, poll results have come much closer to the actual election outcome than expert forecasts. With Brexit, prediction markets were predicting only a 1/3rd chance of a brexit vote. Polls were projecting brexit and stay as neck and neck with the brexit side having a slight advantage. Brexit won. With the primary the polls were counting Trump as ahead quite consistently. Forecasters were much more skeptical about the possibility that Trump could win the primary. The issue here is that the heuristics that forecasters use to predict elections — the ones that normally give better results than just the polls — are very bad at forecasting the effectiveness of populists. The FiveThirtyEight polls-plus forecast gives strong weight to endorsements. <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/">http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/</a> <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6iWtn7aIY">http://www.webcitation.org/6iWtn7aIY</a> This works for predicting voter behavior most of the time, but is terrible at dealing with populists, because populist voters don’t care about experts, as their core objection against the political establishment.</p>
