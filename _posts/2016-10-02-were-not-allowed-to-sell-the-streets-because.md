<p>Everyone should be able to rely on the fact that it is possible to get from point A to point B.</p>
<p>Currently the government does an adequate job of that, and I’m not so sure about your suggestion.</p>
<p>Sometimes people want things, and shouldn’t be able to get them. These include killing other people for no good reason, as well as drastically curtailing their freedom of movement because they have unpopular opinions.</p>

<p>Historically, roads were private and people got places. Then people complained that tolls were too high and got governments to nationalise the roads. I find it very strange that the complaint against going back to private roads isn’t even “the tolls will be high” but “we don’t know whether that system will work”. </p>
<p>This reminds me of the joke about two Russians standing in an hour long queue to get to a Soviet bakery. One says “I hear that, in America, the government doesn’t bake /any/ bread!”, to which the other one responds “Those poor Americans! They must be starving without bread!”</p>
<p>(find and replace “bread” and “buses” and you know how Canadians responded to me talking about the fast, cheap, private buses of my homeland.) </p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how quickly people decide a government is necessary for X, right after the government yanks that function out of the hands of a market that was already getting it done.</p>

<p>The Roman roads were private? TIL. Anyway, things are different now. There are gigantic companies, there is internet, with both fast communication and toxoplasma, people aren’t about to starve (which means they can spend more resources in status games bullying other people, rather than needed money to buy food).</p>
<p>All the resources we have now mean we’re closer to a perfect market. In a perfect market, discrimination happens, because people are willing to pay money purely to hurt other people.</p>

<blockquote><p>Then it’s a good thing we decided to let one entity own all the streets and run them according to an incentive system basically uncorrelated with the interests of the people who use them. </p>

<p>As opposed to those vicious private monopolies where hundreds of companies own different streets in the same city since, you know, it is actually really easy to take different routes depending on the prices and there are basically zero incentives toward natural monopoly in road networks.</p></blockquote><p>zero incentives toward natural monopoly in road networks</p></blockquote>
<p>If you control all the roads, you have absolute power. Just take everyone you don’t like, and refuse to let any vehicle with food go to them.</p>
<p>Controlling roads is controlling peoples’ access to making mutually beneficial trades, which is precisely what I thought libertarianism is supposed to be against.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, I should have specified that I meant roads in the modern era - particular Britain and the US, where I’ve looked at the issue. </p>
<p>Incentives to monopoly aren’t “Oh, wouldn’t it be lovely if I had all the roads” motivating you to buy all of them. An incentive to monopoly is a situation where one entity controlling the entire supply of a thing is so much more efficient that everyone else gives up. </p>
<p>You would be very powerful if you controlled all the land, all the food, all the clothing manufacturers, all the construction firms, etc. And yet, no one has been able to do that (without government gun) because it’s so pointlessly costly that you’ll bankrupt yourself trying, fail to get all of it, and then have someone else outcompete you.</p>
<p>In a world where anyone can buy land, build a road, and charge a toll, owning all the roads is impossible, because someone else will just build new roads. And then your business will crash and burn because the huge bureaucratic behemoth you’d need to manage billions of miles of roads would do a poor job relative to competitors. *side-eyes the State*</p>

<p><i>“An incentive to monopoly is a situation where one entity controlling the entire supply of a thing is so much more efficient that everyone else gives up.”</i> <br /></p><p>And roads aren’t this? </p><p>Natural monopolies tend to occur in sectors where fixed costs are large compared to marginal costs. That’s pretty much how roads work. The quantity of land you need to build the road and the cost of buying it is pretty much a fixed quantity (until the road reaches the congestion point, then marginal costs become more important). There are some marginal costs in construction and maintenance, but these are also largely fixed costs too.  </p>
