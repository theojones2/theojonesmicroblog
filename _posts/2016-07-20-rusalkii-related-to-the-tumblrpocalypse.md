<p>Related to the tumblrpocalypse everyone is predicting: <br />
1. Does anyone know of a way to back up blogs doable from mobile? I probably won’t have my laptop functional until late August<br />
2. If anyone wants a non-tumblr way to contact me, I finally acquired an email that isn’t immediately traceable to my irl identity. If anyone wants that (no promises that I’ll check it regularly), feel free to ask.<br />
3. How likely is it that Yahoo or whoever they might sell tumblr to would /actually/ kill it without warning? Because at the moment I really really doubt it, I’m just hedging my bets.<br />
4. Why did everyone start predicting our impeding doom anyway? Was it the autoplay ads? Because that seems like a bit of an overreaction.</p>
