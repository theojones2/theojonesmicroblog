<p>In light of the controversy that has been extending back for more than half a year at this point, something extremely depressing has come to light.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, Totalbiscuit, a popular games critic who is supported by GamerGate (though he claims to be neutral), wrote a lengthy Twitlonger <a href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sl499g">questioning the theory of media influence</a>, particularly in video games, asking “where are the scientists?”<br /></p>
<p>In response, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/2yeh1f/in_answer_to_where_are_the_scientists_who_study/">an actual social scientist posted a lengthy explanation of media influence</a>. It’s a very good read, and I suggest anyone who’s interested read it. However, what was most important was what was added at the end.<br /></p>
<blockquote><p><b>[added on reflection]</b> Let me also say on other thing. There are a number of us in academia who love games, care about games, and believe games are important.  We have been working for years to make games a legitimate tool for education and for study, and we were making progress.  <b>People were starting to take games seriously.</b>  And then came GamerGate. I have seen the careful progress of a decade come crashing down, and now, when I go to talk about games to industry groups or fellow academics, GamerGate always comes up as an example of how terrible and immature people who play games are.  It will take years and years to repair the damage, and it is absolutely devastating to the serious study and application of the power of games to real problems.  
We are going to have trouble getting grants, getting foundations to fund
 games, and getting people to take us seriously.  It is devastating and 
makes me very sad.<br /></p></blockquote>
<p>For many years, people have been fighting for games to be recognized seriously as an art form. GamerGate, as it seems, has caused serious damage to that. Social scientists have been studying the influence of games, not just because of their negative effects, but because of the potential <i>positive </i>effects as well. Games could potentially be a powerful tool to help teach empathy, and increase satisfaction and happiness.</p>
<p>But now that GamerGate has shattered public perception of gaming in academia, we may never be able to fully understand how to allow games to reach their full potential in this regard. But it’s not just media studies in video games that have suffered.</p>
<p>Rebecca HG, also known as 8BitBecca, is a video game archivist. Her work is vitally important to the future of video games, as the passage of time guarantees that physical storage media degrades and becomes unusable. Within decades, many out-of-print games may be lost forever, outside of illegal ROMs.</p>
<p>But now, thanks to GamerGate, <a href="https://storify.com/8BitBecca/video-game-archiving-post-gamergate">video game archiving as a professional practice is all but dead</a>.</p>

Academics refusing to take games seriously means that games can never be realized as an art form. Even worse, without academia the task of preserving, understanding, and maintaining the cultural history of games becomes a daunting task. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=deq3xI8OmCkC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=half+of+all+films+made+before+1950&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cY8nSeesh0&amp;sig=E9CCCLz88BSEY4zZ1HCs2ammIaM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9Ez9VKXaL4fIsQTR0YKIAg&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=half%20of%20all%20films%20made%20before%201950&amp;f=false">Half of all American films made before 1950 are lost forever</a>, and were it not for the work of archivists and academics, it’s likely we would never have been able to preserve even that much.<br /></p>
<p>So what happens to video games when academics don’t take them seriously at all? What happens when people refuse to archive games or study their cultural significance?</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, video games will have no future. If we do not take care to study the cultural history of games, it may forever disappear to us when cartridges and CDs inevitably die, emulators become obsolete, servers shut down, manuals are lost, and the publisher history fades into obscurity.<br /></p>
<p>This should make <i>any </i>gamer uncomfortable, but unfortunately, this is not the case. GamerGate has not been shy about their disdain for academia in video games, as evidenced by the popularity of anti-academic figures such as the Youtuber known as “Sargon of Akkad”, who is one of the most widely-praised supporters of GamerGate. Just reading the title of one of his videos tells you all that you need to know:<br /></p>
<figure class="tmblr-embed"></figure><p>In this context, <a href="https://archive.today/OVf8f">GamerGate’s reaction to the news that academia is no longer taking games seriously</a> is <a href="https://archive.today/1JzM4">depressingly predictable</a>.<br /></p>

<p>I don’t think it’s any coincidence at all that that last screenshot specifically mentions humanities; I strongly suspect that there’s a lot of overlap between the sorts of people who support GamerGate and the sorts of people who believe that anything besides a STEM degree is fake, lazy academia, and literary critique of games of any kind (including, of course, feminist critique) falls under the umbrella of the humanities. if we start hearing news about schools choosing to drop support for game development in computer science programs as a result of GamerGate, then there’ll probably be a huge uproar, because ultimately, according to GamerGate, videogame development should be little more than a skilled trade that only requires proper execution of precisely honed talents, rather than an artform that requires an understanding of the process of creating meaningful art.</p>

<p>My strong impression of GamerGate is that it’s built on the foundational belief that games should be treated as existing only of, by, and for an incredibly narrow demographic and set of intentions; and that the appropriate response to engagement with games from anywhere outside that demographic and those intentions is “slash and burn indiscriminately.“ </p>
<p>Which is to say: I’m really not sure why anyone* was expecting them to be anything <i>but</i> overjoyed at the revelation that they’d driven someone else away. Legitimacy was never part of the agenda. Progress was <i>definitely</i> never part of the agenda.</p>
<p>*I mean, unless you actually bought that it was about ethics in games journalism; in which case you are apparently already pitching your tent so far into the realm of denial that I am no longer surprised by <i>anything</i> you believe.</p>

<p>I have met a large number of people of widely diverse views who considered themselves to be variously pro- or anti- gamergate, and the ultimate conclusion I came up with is that there’s no real “thing” it’s about, but in particular, that’s just as true of things like your impression of gamergate as it is of the “ethics in games journalism” thing.</p>

<p>My favorite conversation on the topic so far involved watching two trans women who are generally pro-gamergate get lectured by two cis men who are generally anti-gamergate on how misogyny and homophobia are real problems which need to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>The major things I’ve concluded are:</p>

<ol><li>It doesn’t matter whether or not anyone ever cared about “ethics in game journalism”; the moment people decided that “gamergate” was hostile to “games journalists”, it became <em>incredibly stupid</em> to believe anything that journalists said on the topic, because they had a very strong vested interest in presenting it a given way.</li>
<li>There is pretty clear evidence that people who had no interest whatsoever in any of the topics related to gamergate, for or against, were going around harassing the shit out of both gamergaters and anti-gamergaters, trying to prod them into attacking each other, and it worked <em>really</em> well since people on both sides were completely prepared to believe anything negative they heard about the other side. Because they’d been harassed.</li>
<li>A number of “gamergaters” have done immense damage to the ability of anyone to talk about these issues… But so have a number of anti-gamergaters. Because at this point, claiming that something is “associated with gamergate” allows you to attack it and dismiss it out of hand for a large audience.</li>
<li>For instance, look at the “supported by gamergaters, although he claims to be useful” thing. That’s a beautiful bit of manipulative writing there; it communicates simultaneously that the person is associated with the Unclean thing and should not be taken seriously, <em>and</em> that they’re dishonest about it. (Or, if you’re used to unpacking stuff like that, it tells you that the person who wrote it is writing propaganda, and should not be trusted.)</li>
<li>I’ve seen some pretty interesting writing from both “sides”. Of those, both the worst and the best were generally from people who were claiming to be “pro-gamergate”. There’s a complete and total disconnect between those two groups; there’s naive, reactionary, sexist assholes, and there’s also some really thoughtful people.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I’ve rarely seen anything anti- that wasn’t, fundamentally, all about circling the wagons and demonizing people. So while the <em>worst</em> writing I’ve seen was all gamergaters, the overall average of the anti- side is pretty horrifically bad.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>“The media you’re criticising says you’re part of a hate group, therefore you’re no longer allowed to criticise the media.”<br /></p>

<p>To me, this is how it started, and all the other bullshit surrounding the whole event flowed from that.</p>

<p>And a lot of it was complete and utter bullshit, from every ‘side’ remotely associated with it. This could’ve been over in two weeks, maybe even less, if the initial conversation had just been allowed to take place, without all the lines drawn in the sand, and the gatekeeping, and the banning, and the censorship.</p>

<p>Every single terrible thing that happened in these two years surrounding this event could’ve been prevented if a couple of people with serious power in deciding what discussion would and would not happen (and this is what the media is) had used that power responsibly.</p>

<p>Somehow though, the notion of a few academic hacks no longer seeing games as ‘positive’ because gamers stopped allowing themselves to be talked down to by their supposed intellectual superiors is not one of the things I’d consider ‘terrible’, but that may be too nitty-gritty for this post.</p>

<p>If they can fund Television Studies conferences, they will fund anything. So much of this comes from academics who have a passion for the subject themselves. There are dedicated funds for games as art, often created by the industry themselves. There are PhDs in the field, did they suddenly get fired? DIGRA didn’t suddenly stop existing. There are people studying telenovellas in a Freudian context and doctorates on old obscure philosophers through a new lens that’s only interesting to a handful of scholars in the same field. There is probably some skepticism into research possibly being tainted, but people overestimate the public memory. Some fields subsist decades in obscurity until being rediscovered and flourishing (hello, Aby Warburg). </p>
<p> “Within decades, many out-of-print games may be lost forever, outside of illegal ROMs.” Thus it is actually preserved. How much shovelware is worth preserving other than to the academics? We never know when something might become significant for some bit of history research, but Sturgeon’s Law applies to all content. How many old novels and almanacks do we browse other than to snark at the titles? </p>
<p>Games-for-good is also a killer to games-as-art, since it primarily evaluates it as a social utility. Videogames should realize their full potential? Democratization of the tools to make them will do that, not research into the road to that. Criticism overestimates its role in making art good art. </p>
<p>Academic topics have survived outside the whims of the mainstream decades and decades. Stop panicking. </p>
