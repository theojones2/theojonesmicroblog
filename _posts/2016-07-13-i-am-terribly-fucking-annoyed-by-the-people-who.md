  I am terribly fucking annoyed by the
  people who are criticizing the police
  for using a drone on that terrorist.
  What were the police supposed to do?
  Wait for him to put down his guns and
  come quietly? Politely shuffle into a
  line and throw down their weapons to
  make it easier on him? Wait until he
  started shooting into the crowd of
  civilians THEN tried to talk to him
  calmly?

<blockquote><p>Eh, they had already been trying to negotiate with him for quite some time and he was badly wounded and surrounded.</p><p>Sure, they had to end the standoff somehow but he probably would have eventually passed out from blood loss, if he hadn’t already when they blew him up - he probably could have been taken alive at minimal risk if they had just waited. I don’t want to Monday morning quarterback too much but the police had control of the situation and they’re supposed to be professionals, they had plenty of options, and they set a pretty fucked-up precedent here. I hope that this doesn’t become the routine method for resolving all police standoffs in the future.</p><p>That is, of course, if any of the events they described actually happened the way they said they did. We have to trust their word of the police on that and that’s not worth much these days.</p></blockquote><p><p>That said. I don’t think that it was a bomb-laden robot/”drone” matters much here. If a police officer snuck into the building and threw a grenade into the room where the shooter was, the moral tradeoffs would be the same here.</p><p>Drone usages abroad aren’t morally/legally dubious because it&rsquo;s a drone that sends a missile at someone. The drone stries are dubious because 1) the people bombed often aren’t in active combat at the moment of the strike, and 2) the territorial integrity of another nation-state is breached. Neither apply here. </p></p>
