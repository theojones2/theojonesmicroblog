<p>Remember how great you thought it was that  programming remained a field where you could achieve success by being smart, instead of by being barred by credentialism?<br /></p>
<p>Remember how you talked about how this probably wouldn’t last and the gatekeepers would come for us eventually?</p>

18. It is no longer a defence, for a company using an e-commerce platform, to say that
it was not aware of the risk of SQL injection based attacks, or similarly established and
in some cases routine forms of cyber-penetration. The ICO should introduce a series of
escalating fines, based on the lack of attention to threats and vulnerabilities which
have led to previous breaches. A data breach facilitated by a ‘plain vanilla’ SQL
attack, for example, or continued vulnerabilities and repeated attacks, could thus
trigger a significant fine. We were also surprised that there is no requirement to make
security a major consideration in the design of new IT systems and apps. <b>We therefore
recommend that security by design should be a core principle for new system and apps
development and <i>a mandatory part of developer training,</i> with existing development
staff retrained as necessary.</b><br /></p></blockquote>
