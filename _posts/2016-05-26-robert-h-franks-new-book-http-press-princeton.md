<p>Robert H. Frank released a new book<br /><a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10663.html" rel="nofollow">http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10663.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6hmmyiSk0" rel="nofollow">http://www.webcitation.org/6hmmyiSk0</a></p>
<p>Robert H. Frank’s other book <em>The Darwin Economy</em> had one of the better explanations that I’ve seen for why worker protection regulations like overtime laws are needed. There are positional externalities involved in working hours. Status both within your field of work and in society as a whole are based on how you are doing relative to others. By working extreme hours you can look better than your co-workers, this creates a dynamic that affects others. Its like doping in a sport. If you dope, you can gain enough of an advantage to force everyone else to dope. But if it were possible to stop everyone from dopeing than it would benefit almost everyone.</p>
