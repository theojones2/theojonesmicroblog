<p>Hillary and Donald are the two <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Ffivethirtyeight.com%2Ffeatures%2Famericans-distaste-for-both-trump-and-clinton-is-record-breaking%2F&amp;t=N2IxOTMxYzQwOTUzZjg2ZWJlZjczZTEzYzU0N2Y4NmFlZjRjY2FmMyxWRG81OGdRTg%3D%3D">least popular candidates in history</a>. The <i>only</i> possible way <i>either</i> of them could <i>ever</i> win an election is because people are terrified the other guy will win and be even worse.</p>
<p>But … c’mon, you can’t throw away your vote to some no-name third-party candidate nobody else is gonna vote for, right? Then the other guy <i>might </i>actually win!</p>
<p>No. There’s a better way.</p>
<p>Among millennials, Gary Johnson  is doing better than <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fredalertpolitics.com%2F2016%2F07%2F10%2Fpew-gary-johnson-jumps-2nd-place-among-millennials%2F&amp;t=MDBhMWU2ZTcyOGMyYjQyNWUyMGRkOGNiYjIzMGYzNjQzYmIxNjQ5YSxWRG81OGdRTg%3D%3D">Donald Trump</a>. He could seriously recieve a large enough share of the vote that neither mainstream candidate receives a plurality. In that case, the House of Representatives chooses from among the <i>three</i> top Presidential candidates.</p>
<p>Can you imagine them safely choosing either Hillary or Donald? Two irresponsible criminals whose followers hate each other to the point of violence? No.</p>
<p>They’d choose Johnson, the compromise candidate. But only if you vote for him.</p>
<p>But who is Johnson? Voting for a person you don’t fully understand out of hate and fear would make you no better than the followers of those other candidates, right? Of course you’re right.</p>
<p>The thing is, Johnson <i>genuinely is</i> a compromise candidate. He’s OK with a woman’s right to choose, but only until viability, and - being libertarian - he’s against the state funding it. He’s opposed to bailouts, and committed to reducing national debt, and wants to reduce incarceration - <i>genuinely</i> committed, as a libertarian, not riding on the bandwagon. He wants the government to quit interfering in marriages, he’s in favor of freedom of religion, he’s in favor of regulating prostitution.</p>
<p>He’s opposed to gun control, but also opposed to pointless attempts at immigration restriction. I know a lot of my followers feel strongly about both of those in opposite directions; hopefully you can find it in you to compromise on one in exchange for the other. <br /></p>
<p>He’s opposed to the War on Drugs, and to government interference in the school system. He believes in global warming, but opposes cap-and-trade; he’s in favor of nuclear power, which <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fclimate.nasa.gov%2Fnews%2F903%2Fcoal-and-gas-are-far-more-harmful-than-nuclear-power%2F&amp;t=MDIyMzI1OWY0YjFjZTc3MGU2YjA5ZGFhN2NkYmRjZDdlZjZlM2UwOSxWRG81OGdRTg%3D%3D">would save countless lives from coal pollution</a>. He wants more funding to encourage fathers to be in their children’s lives. He’s opposed to the NSA on constitutional grounds.</p>
<p>He’s opposed to the pointless warmongering both our false candidates want.</p>
<p><i>Vote Gary Johnson.</i></p>

<p>as a non-US citizen I throw my weight behind Johnson!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vote Johnson if you care so little about people who cannot economically compete that they don’t merit even noting the compromise.</p>
<p>(That, unlike either of those candidates, they would attempt to shut down all forms of welfare. Including disability, support for the sick and disabled who were poor, etc, as well as the more general programmes. But hey! Maybe they’re middle of the road on <i>everything you actually care about</i>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>they might do the opposite of shutting down the one form of welfare i most care about, yet you’re apparently not even aware of. so, irony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is about UBI, then, no, they won’t.</p>
<p>

The <a href="https://www.lp.org/platform">US Libertarian Party Platform</a> includes </p>
<blockquote>
<p>

As respect for property rights is fundamental to maintaining a free and prosperous society, it follows that the freedom to contract to obtain, retain, profit from, manage, or dispose of one’s property must also be upheld.<br /></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>

All persons are entitled to keep the fruits of their labor. We call for the repeal of the income tax, the abolishment of the Internal Revenue Service and all federal programs and services not required under the U.S. Constitution.<br /></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored Social Security system and transition to a private voluntary system. The proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals. We believe members of society will become even more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in this realm.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They do not back UBI- they’re ideologically opposed to it for the same reasons they’re opposed to other kinds of welfare, they’re standard right-libertarians who view taxation to provide for welfare as a violation of liberty. And because they’re liberty-focused and not consequentialist they don’t especially intend to try to achieve similar outcomes, and won’t stop just because people are hurting. Can’t violate liberty for little things like homelessness, after all; liberty is sacred.</p>
<p>And it isn’t like the kind of political discourse which is so obsessed with social issues to the exclusion of others that people recommend them as “middle of the road” without even <i>mentioning</i> their extreme standpoint on welfare will actually notice or care that people who don’t have well-off friends or family are in trouble. They don’t care about those people now.</p>
<p>Edit: There’s also “

All efforts by government to redistribute wealth, or to control or manage trade, are improper in a free society.” in the platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>The LP is extreme because it’s marginal; in realpolitik they would inevitably have to make concessions to the vast majority which supports welfare and getting libertarians’ input to welfare would be far better than getting republicans’ input to it. Libertarians in office would be far more pragmatic and moderate. And when it comes to libertarians being pragmatic, there are two very standard talking points: LVT and UBI which would both be a very good improvement over the current system. Mainstreaming libertarianism (in the ideal scenario the LP would carve out a substantial space in national politics disrupting the GOP and its militarist-neoconservative alliance) would be expected to result in something closer to the good parts of Scandinavian countries than to the pipe dreams of policy documents.</p>
<p>(It may be astonishing, but these countries routinely rank above the US in many rankings and measures of “economic freedom”, and some libertarian-leaning people have suggested that eg. Sweden is a pragmatic example of a generous welfare state that’s less disruptive to the economy. It’s kind of funny to see people pointing at Sweden and saying “this country proves socialism works” and others saying “this country proves libertarianism works”, but that would make perfect sense if Sweden had taken some good ideas from socialists and some from libertarians to dilute the bullshit that would otherwise be expected.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/is-libertarian-gary-johnson-a-factor-in-clinton-trump-matchup/2016/06/10/05025d84-2dc5-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html">He waved off the popular libertarian catch phrase “taxation is theft.”</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/is-libertarian-gary-johnson-a-factor-in-clinton-trump-matchup/2016/06/10/05025d84-2dc5-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html">“It is theft, yes, but the reality is that we’re not gonna abolish taxes,” said Johnson. “I mean, if I’m elected president, you can expect me to sign anything that reduces taxes.” Asked about the old libertarian idea of a “basic income” replacing the welfare state — an idea recently resuscitated by Charles Murray, the libertarian author and political scientist — Johnson said the same thing. “If that’s legislation that gets passed — hey, I’m gonna look really seriously at signing it.”</a></p>
<p>In 2016, as a candidate, Johnson talks about balancing the budget but lacks the zeal of libertarians who think the state could be cut in half without consequence. He’d keep Social Security for current retirees. He wouldn’t abolish the EPA, after learning in New Mexico how the government policed bad actors.“In the libertarian view, without the EPA, you as an individual could sue under the law,” said Johnson. “But not really. You don’t have deep pockets to go up against Chevron.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://fairtaxer.com/fairtax/the-fairtax-prebate/">FairTax which Johnson supports includes a $2.5k “prebate”</a> which is basically a tiny UBI for adults and increases for those with children. It’s very small, but as a step in the right direction it’s fucking huge. In total, the prebate wouldn’t quite completely compensate for the welfare cuts Johnson is promising (43% instead of 100%; considering that healthcare and SS are about 2 trillion the prebate would be half of the cuts and distributed differently) but it would alleviate them and do it in a superior way compared to the programs that would be reduced. (And it would be rather trivial for more leftist governments later to increase the prebate to shift the system towards a proper UBI that’s actually possible to live on. In fact I’m highly suspecting that a Johnson presidency would have a good chance of being followed by a someone-like-sanders presidency as the poor people Johnson’s plans don’t really help that much would rise up and demand improvement to their situation; improvement that might actually be easier to implement if Johnson’s economic policies have otherwise created sustainable growth.)</p>
<p>(FairTax would also eliminate the regressive nature of payroll taxes and is alleged to improve the taxation of wealth and eliminate the discrepancy between income taxes and capital gains, the latter being currently taxed less due to payroll taxes etc., thus shifting some tax burden to capitalists from workers.)</p>
<p>In addition, Johnson’s ideas have some credibility for making it possible to lower the price of healthcare; the situation in the US is uniquely fucked-up because of its hybrid of public-private spending where nobody really controls costs, and proper deregulation would make it possible to innovate cheaper models (or just copypaste working ideas from elsewhere; if some insurance company started providing its own Singapore-style system with Singapore-level prices it would pretty quickly get approximately all the customers) that ensure poor people get better care for less money, which we know is possible because <b>literally everyone else</b> is doing it. Letting states do their own medicare+medicaid systems would create an ecosystem of different experiments where at least some places would probably come up with relatively good implementations that could be copied elsewhere. At least it would be a lower level of government that would possibly be less subject to the obscene bureaucratic overhead of federal.</p>
<p>Also, Johnson seems to have taken some stance towards reducing sex work prohibition which would be a massive boon to some of the most vulnerable workers in the country. And immigration has been shown to boost economic growth and even increase native wages as Greg the manual laborer becomes Greg the english-speaking foreman for Manuel the manual laborer whose wages are also boosted massively because he’s allowed to work in the US instead of Mexico.</p>
<p>And, well, this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Asked how his presidency might begin, he starts by describing executive action, like reclassifying drugs (all of them) and ending the National Security Agency.<br /></p></blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote><p>He would not abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, since he argues Americans cannot expect the courts alone to protect their shared ecological inheritance. “You don’t have deep pockets to go up against Chevron,” he told Weigel.<br /></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I should acknowledge that these are good points, especially about how Johnson is deviating from his party’s line in a more pragmatic/somewhat consequences-concerned fashion, although I think you are severely overestimating the strength of the welfare state; Scandinavia’s is really unusually strong and well supported, and the US’s is very much not.</p>
<p>In particular, Johnson would be mostly compromising with Republicans, not Democrats, who are a minority in both houses and right now have much of their influence through their control of the presidency. So if you swap the president to an LP candidate, it’s going to be LP-Republican compromise welfare policy rather than LP-Democrat compromise welfare policy that replaces Democrat-Republican compromise welfare policy. The part they’re likely to agree on is the repeal of existing stuff, and both are willing to go without replacement if they can’t agree on what one would be, constrained only by fear of a severe negative reaction by the public- and the public is less welfare-supporting than elsewhere, so that constraint still permits things to get very bad.</p>
<p>In general, I think you’re overestimating the extent to which realpolitik would refine it into a kind of sanity; we’re not even looking at “cuts now, sensible system later”, but “cuts now, and hopefully pressure will form them into a shape that makes them support a sensible system later”, and I’m dubious that will happen.</p>
<p>I think the Democrats do have *some* power (threat of filibuster in one of the chambers, was it?) but not much, and as I understand it that could be eliminated if they did the so-called nuclear option and got rid of the kind of silly filibuster rules.<br /></p>
<p>A left-wing swing in four years as a result is plausible, but the thing with being poor and having few lines of support is that you generally don’t have the liquidity to just ride out four years without severe utility losses, homelessness if the Republicans decide to send Johnson a bill stopping housing programmes which is absolutely something they would do, hunger (probably not literally starvation, but bad) if they decide to send a bill cutting food stamps (and not replacing with cash benefits, because seriously they have no interest in doing that, it’s like the “if they cut immigration from relatively rich countries they could increase it for poorer ones” hypothetical, it’s not what they want to do), etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are some uncomfortable tradeoffs that I don’t want to sweep under the rug by any means. Although a lot of republicans’ supporters are pro-welfare in some ways (”keep the government’s grubby hands off my medicare!” etc.) so there might be hope that the Congress would bend to popular pressure to soften the policies. Although one could say the same about Clinton: if she’s facing a republican congress she might not be able to get much good done either (but she would be a huge risk factor in the bad stuff; <a href="https://www.isidewith.com/candidate-guide/bernie-sanders-vs-gary-johnson">in fact Johnson is more pro-civil rights than even<i> Bernie </i>on many issues</a>).</p>
<p>I’m not happy about the situation where the only choice is someone with such a questionable welfare policy, or someone with such a questionable civil rights policy, or a dangerous populist joke, but Johnson is one candidate that should be taken very seriously because this is an opportunity to queer the binary of the parties and create possibilities for better choices later on. It’s total bullshit that with the situation being what it is the NSA and the mil-ind-cpx are effectively holding the poor hostage and it’s shitty but the prospects of eliminating so many of the things that break the people’s legs could be worth the risk of losing some crutches.</p>
<p>After all, poor people don’t have the liquidity to just ride out four years without incarceration (if the drug war and carceral state aren’t stopped), being shot by cops (if systematic police abuse isn’t stopped) being stuck on the other side of the mexican border (if immigration continues to be artificially restricted), getting bombed by drones (if the imperialist adventurism carries on), and so on.</p>
<p>The senate filibuster is definitely an option; needs 60 republicans to be filibuster-proof and that might not be happening. I’m not familiar enough with the details of US political operations to know how the pragmaticities would work, and I’m not blaming anyone poor who defensively votes for Clinton just to avoid welfare cuts, but this is a very serious opportunity to do things that wouldn’t normally be possible. (And a republican president later on could just do the fiscal-conservative stuff without the civil rights stuff, so relying on defending one’s short-term position every 4 years while making long-term sacrifices is a predictable recipe for disaster. The state security apparatus and its ability to destroy movements that seek change are a far bigger threat to lasting justice than Johnson’s economic policy.)</p>
<p>If Johnson’s welfare policies were different I would endorse him 100% without reservations, but the situation being what it is I endorse him with reservations. Abolishing the NSA, ending all kinds of useless wars etc. would be very significant improvements that would normally be very strongly outside the overton window but now they are at least theoretically achievable. And in the longer term the cronyists and the deep state are a threat to everyone and a massive source of harm to poor people as well. This is the traditional statist devil’s bargain: they link the well-being of the vulnerable with state power and thus prop up their own position and everything is shit. And the extent of the state power even makes it so that radical new ideas can’t even be tried if there is no promise of immediate returns because “too many lives are at stake” and meanwhile the state surveillance apparatus silently grows to control everything and strangle the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this is utterly ridiculous</p>
<p>the idea that Johnson would be more likely to end state surveillance than to slash welfare is laughable, especially in light of the quote from the johnson/bernie comparison you yourself linked:</p>
<figure class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/3c5ed851bf8672c2ad7ef9458722d733/tumblr_inline_oa7kyeyOMG1qd2z2m_540.png" /></figure><p>so how exactly is he going to both dismantle the state surveillance system while also continuously monitoring refugees?</p>
<p>also in the entire list i didn’t see a <i>single issue</i> which could be described as johnson being more pro-civil rights than bernie, so it seems that much like the claim that johnson is likely to bring UBI, that’s pure fabrication on the part of the johnson voters. i can’t help but notice that in contrast to bernie, johnson<b> <i>does</i></b> support solitary confinement for juveniles. hm. doesn’t seem like someone i’d want to vote for on the basis of being anti-prison.</p>
<p>the notion that libertarianism would prevent cronyism is nonsense, seeing as cronyism is based primarily on campaign contributions (bribes) and johnson, like most libertarianism, is strongly in favor of making it even easier for corporations to make campaign contributions. the claim that capitalism is different than cronyism is just bullshit libertarian misdirection, cronyism is the inevitable result of capitalism and they can never be separated. <br /></p>
<p>also the quote “this is an opportunity to queer the binary of the parties” seems like it’s founded on an extremely flimsy analogy.<br /></p>
