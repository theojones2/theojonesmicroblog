<p>So I read a convo in the rationalistsphere with people twisting Clinton talking about how her attempt to pass her law exams while the men were screaming at her not to even try do so, into her hating men because one was trying to avoid the draft by getting into law school.</p>
<p>Because clearly Clinton was bad for not giving up her career so one guy could have a <i>chance</i> of avoiding the draft. Because clearly the solution to the draft is to scream at women to give up their careers as opposed to, oh I dunno, screaming at <i>politicians to end the fucking draft</i>.</p>
<p>I give up, I have to give the feminists a victory for once: They’re clearly right that people just hate Clinton because she’s a woman.</p>
<p>There’s literally no other explanation I can think of at this point for the constant double standards applied towards her, especially when her opponent is an incompetent total asshole that lies constantly, wants to implement measures that would be hateful towards anyone who’s even slightly different, and is in bed with a hostile foreign power, yet he still stands a chance of winning and SHE is the one who gets the most criticism from everyone.</p>
<p>Christ. If every other Western country can handle having women in power without issues, Americans can get over your stupid fucking misogynist shit, too.</p>

<p>Nah, like, I agree with you, and it *is* ridiculous to expect her to give up her spot like that, but it seems like a really off-color story for a politician to brag about — why would she tell us that story? Does she and her giant team of staffers think it makes her look more likable? Who the fuck is she hiring that “once someone begged me to let my spot go to someone who might die otherwise” is a relatable story about how she should be prez? (not that it effects aggregate utility, because presumably a fixed number of people would be drafted) That thought is what scares me, and I think what everyone else is complaining about: It boggles the mind that this isn’t comparable with the Kitty Dukakis gaffe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In context, that wasn’t the actual focus of the story. It was about how Clinton had to harden herself to ignore people screaming at her both literally and metaphorically, and that’s why she often comes across as cold or robotic. It wasn’t bragging so much as offering an origin story for a behavior she’s often criticized for. </p>

<p>Yeah, that’s what I thought too. As well as saying that while sometimes people’s anger and hurt is understandable, you can’t always act based on it.</p>
<p>I could see that being good for a pol to say – “this explains why I cannot please everyone all the time.” </p>
<p>I can also see it being spectacularly bad for a pol to say, because people like being promised that everything will magically be made all right.</p>
<p>In the context of running against Trump, someone who makes a lot of YUUUUUGE promises he obviously can’t keep, it makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Really, I don’t see what was so bad about what Hillary said. You can’t expect a politician to be on message 24/7. And it was just a bit about her time in law school, she wasn’t even particularly hostile to the person who yelled at her. </p>
