<blockquote>
<p>I get it now.<br /></p>
<p>A culture warrior’s <i>only</i> power is to shift the Overton Window. <br /></p>
<p>The power to deem things “socially unacceptable” is literally the only power they possess.</p>
<p>So that <i>must</i> be the power that can solve <i>every</i> problem.</p>
<p>(Hammer, nail)<br /></p>
<p>So <i>every</i> problem must be caused by the Overton Window being in the wrong place.</p>
<p>If it was possible to individuals to choose to do socially unacceptable things, the threat of social disapproval wouldn’t be the solution to every problem. If it were possible for individuals to glibly brush off social consensus, culture war would be <i>utterly impotent</i>. So it <i>must </i>be<i> literally impossible </i>to do socially unacceptable things.</p>
<p>But we live in a world where horrible things happen every day.</p>
<p>So horrible things must be socially acceptable, even if nobody would ever admit they were. <i>Because it must be literally impossible to do socially unacceptable things, or culture war is impotent.</i>
<br /></p>
<p>If you want to believe that all crime can be eliminated merely by shifting the Overton Window… you must also believe that the only reason crimes occur in the first place is that <i>all crime is within the Overton Window. </i><br /></p>
<p>You must believe that everyone around you secretly believes all crime is good.</p>
<p>hence “Toxic Masculinity”</p>
