<p>Did yall see that article about the clinic for heroine addicts.<br />Free heroine, new needles &amp; a private space to shoot up in all 100% free of cost.</p>

<p>Sighhhhhhh</p>

<p>I think we can have a conversation regarding leniency with white drug users, but I’m more than a bit uncomfortable with a photoset showing those struggling with addiction.</p>
<p>Additionally, the photos that you’re using are from 2011, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2015/12/27/safe-drug-injection-sites-needed-massachusetts/a4NYUT3jvNiPkQ2TlHWsKK/story.html">at Vancouver facility in Canada</a>. If you’re referring to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-seattle-heroin-20160920-snap-story.html">recent article that is talking about Seattle</a>, why are you using photos from Canada?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_injection_site">Supervised injection sites like this are a part of a harm reduction approach to drug use.</a> And they have worked, in the above pictured Canadian facility, they haven’t had an overdose in 13 years. If you have qualms with where certain facilities are being set up, petition your governor or state legislature to build them in other communities. </p>

<p>honestly painting this as a “lol white people” thing is really missing the point and really insensitive to ppl addicted to heroin. also lmao “they give them free heroin” literally no, they just provide the clean needles and safe space to shoot up in and facilities like this are usually partnered with rehab clinics as well. Do you expect addicts to just cold turkey swear heroin off completely (and subsequently die?) They gotta have a means of injecting safely if they have any hope for eventually quitting. Smh. No need to lie.</p>

<p>Oh look, it’s ableism disguised as “mocking white people” again. <br /></p>
