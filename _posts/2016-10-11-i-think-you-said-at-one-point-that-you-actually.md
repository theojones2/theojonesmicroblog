post_title: 'I think you said at one point that you actually like Clinton, as opposed to just seeing her as better than Trump. Does it concern you that any SC justice she nominates will be liberal and therefore highly unlikely to respect the first amendment, and that we&#8217;ll end up with Europe-style hate speech laws? Don&#8217;t you think that will be essentially conceding the fight and allowing the worst SJWs free reign for the foreseeable future? (I mean, yes, that might be better than Trump, but still very bad.)'

<blockquote><p>Progressives’ aggressive disavowal of freedom of speech as a fundamental value does deeply bother me, yes. The weird SJ stuff going on on campuses, for example, one of the reasons I actually consider failing out of my PhD program to be dodging a bullet Neo-style. I could not be more glad I am not a professor.</p>

<p>But:</p>

<p>1) I am not convinced whoever Clinton nominates for the Court will be progressive in this way. Clinton is an establishment centrist liberal who came of age long before the identity politics boom. While I do suspect she’d be willing to listen to young activists more than, say, some Bernie supporters fear, I am not convinced her nominee will be a Mari Matsuda type.</p>

<p>2) I think it is important not to base one’s political stance on one issue, even one that is profoundly personally important to you. I believe a conservative nominee would do more damage than a liberal one in general, even if the liberal one was “an SJW.”</p></blockquote><p><p>I would guess that if Clinton is elected the nominees would look a lot like Ginsberg – ie. definitively left-wing, and perhaps too ideological, but not <i>THAT</i> extreme– but the chances of a Mari Matsuda tier ideologue getting nominated and confirmed are exceedingly slim*. </p><p>I would suspect that, if anything, Trump is much more likely to nominate a totally extreme right-wing ideologue, than Clinton is to nominate an extreme left-wing ideologue. </p><p>Personally, I would like more centrist judges of the Kennedy or Roberts mold. But I think the chances are that the next SCOTUS appointees will be at least somewhat ideological.  <br /></p><p>*pfff.. need less decaf today — I at first put “<i>not exceedingly slim</i>” which was about the opposite of what I meant.</p></p>
