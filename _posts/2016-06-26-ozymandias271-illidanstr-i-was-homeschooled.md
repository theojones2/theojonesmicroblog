<p>Unschoolers IIRC typically score about a grade level below everyone else (other homeschoolers and conventional schoolers), and people who attend unschool-like school situations are also typically below grade level.</p>
<p>Naturally, that does not mean <i>literally every unschooler </i>is below grade level.</p>

<p>I was homeschooled using a style pretty close to standard curriculum, but I know a lot of people who were unschooled. In my subjective experience the unschoolers did pretty poorly compared to standard grade level early in their education, but pretty quickly caught up to par during the later part of their education (middle and high school). </p>
