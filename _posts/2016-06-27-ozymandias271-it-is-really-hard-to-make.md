<blockquote>
<p>it is really hard to make arguments of the form “I also disagree with so-and-so, but you really should take them more seriously than you currently are– stop strawmanning them and sneering at them, and generally start treating them with respect as a person who is capable of intelligently contributing to discussion”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least in part because people assume one is supporting the argument instead of merely supposing its reasonableness. </p><p>“It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” &mdash; Aristotle</p>
