<p>Lets say that you are a drug company. Your drug for $disease has been successful, but your exclusive marketing rights and patents are about to expire. What do you do? Simple. Create a variant of it with a bit of dye or something else that is non-clinically active. Run a clinical trial on that sucker. But this time focus it on <i>women</i> (or the demographic of your choice). The trial will almost certainly be successful, because you know your drug works on the population as a whole, and women kind of have a few similarities with the human population as a whole. Now you have a drug that treats $disease in <i>women</i>. Exclusive marketing rights time.</p>
<p>This pretty much happens straight up with <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL">so called Me-Too drugs</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="#en--1" id="enref--1">1</a></sup>. But the same general tactic is good for think-tanks who want to mislead people.</p>
<p>On social media I saw, the following article linked, with the following section quoted<br /><a href="http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11-Gerwin_The-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-and-Small-Business_Boosting-Exports-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11-Gerwin_The-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-and-Small-Business_Boosting-Exports-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The average women- owned exporting firm, for example, employs over five times more workers and pays an average salary almost $17,000 higher than non-exporting firms owned by womenâ€¦..</p></blockquote>
<p> <sup class="endnote"><a href="#en--2" id="enref--2">2</a></sup><br />
Trade improves gender equality. Sounds good.</p>
<p>At first I was wondering what causes the gender aspect here. Do cross culture differences suppress the effect of sexism? And then I realized that the article was a non-peer reviewed article from a think-tank with a strong view on trade (the Progressive Policy Institute). What do we know about ideological think tanks? Ah yes. They exist to promote their political views. If this means being misleading, then so be it. I got really skeptical when the paper had no comparison to other demographic groups (except minorities).</p>
<p>I then checked the source for that article, which was this article from the Census Bureau <a href="http://www2.census.gov/econ/sbo/07/sbo_export_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www2.census.gov/econ/sbo/07/sbo_export_report.pdf</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="#en--3" id="enref--3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Turns out the PPI did the drug company trick mentioned above. That number is purely an artifact of the fact that exporting firms are larger than purely domestic ones. Actually, women owned exporters are actually smaller companies than their man owned counterparts (seems to have something to do with the strong performance of veteran owned firms, as a strong majority of veterans are men).</p>
<p>In statistics this type of manipulation is pretty easy in cases where you can divide things up into arbitrary subgroups. See also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem">modifiable areal unit problem</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="#en--4" id="enref--4">4</a></sup>.</p>
