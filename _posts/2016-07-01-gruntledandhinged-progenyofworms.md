<p>Today I got some (free!) theraputty. It comes in different strengths, but otherwise feels much like sillyputty. It builds hand strength, but, to me, is most fun as a tactile fidget.<br /></p>

<p>I need to look into that for stimming. Does it leave any kind of residue or smell on your hands?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a reasonably good sense of smell, and after playing with it for 15 mins, could not smell anything on my hands. I did not have any residue on my hands or on the ring I wear. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it sticky like silly putty? Will it become entombed within a strongly adhered shell of pet fur within seconds?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it’s not sticky like silly putty (that is, not very sticky at all) but it totally will collect pet fur if that’s on your hands when you play with it. </p>

<p>Neat. Never heard of TheraPutty before. Going to order some because it seems reasonably priced. Amazon reviews say it has a texture that is kind of like silly putty but firmer and more elastic. </p>
