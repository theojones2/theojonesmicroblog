<p>In today’s episode of misleading headlines, we have Huff Po’s front page “SCOTUS SPARES ROE v. WADE Court Rules 5-3 Against TX Anti-Abortion Law”. A few things wrong here. Calling it a 5-3 ruling misses some important distinctions here. Lets go to the actual opinion of the court<br />          (function() { var scribd = document.createElement("script"); scribd.type = "text/javascript"; scribd.async = true; scribd.src = "https://www.scribd.com/javascripts/embed_code/inject.js"; var s = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(scribd, s); })()        <br />
Justice Thomas was the one one who would of straight up upheld the Texas abortion law.The dissent of Alito and Roberts wanted to remand to a lower court based on procedural reasons, but pretty clearly would have struck down at least part of the law. And the core of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> was not in serious doubt here. <em>Roe</em> is effectively settled law at this point.  Only justice Thomas has ever expressed serious interest in overturning it. (See Fogg and Greene’s book <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0189ILWJC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Weged</a></strong> for a source on this)  </p>
