<blockquote><p>They’re not really a thing.</p><p>However, sometimes it’s convenient to <i>act </i>like they are, rather than re-derive morality from first principles every time you want to make a “should” statement.</p><p>(“You see, if you assume from your own sentience that all people are sentient and capable of experiencing pleasure and pain, and that since you desire pleasure and fear pain, and… hangon, we need to define a concept of total utility… [five hours pass, two whiteboards are filled]… and that’s why it’s wrong to mix Skittles and M&amp;Ms in the same bowl.”)<br /></p></blockquote><p></p>
