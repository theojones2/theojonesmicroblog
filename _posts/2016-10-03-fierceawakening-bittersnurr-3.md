<p>so I’ve got this “Narrative Perspectives” class I have to take at university as an exit requirement and it’s like</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>they’re legit saying disabilities are a social construct</p>
<p>and tried to say that hygiene is just “American pop culture” and there was even a group that presented a satire piece making fun of said “hygiene culture”</p>
<p>and when I brought up that hygiene was a heavy focus worldwide I got nasty looks and eye rolls from them like</p>
<p>??? the fuck bruh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “everything ever is just culturally constructed” shit is ubiquitous in universities. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Didn’t you know, cholera is a social construct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey OP, check if anyone in your class wears glasses due to an eye defect - if they support the “social construct” bullshit of disabilities, then tell them to take their glasses off.</p>
<p>That kind of shit can shut them up very quickly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s funny because I wear glasses and every time this shit comes up I’m tempted to yank off my glasses and be like</p>
<p>“HOLY SHIT U RIGHT MY POOR EYESIGHT AND NEARSIGHTEDNESS ARE CURED. AND I MANAGED TO JUST THINK MY VISUAL SNOW AWAY, MY FLOATERS AND VISUAL STATIC ARE GONE. THANK U. I OWE YOU MY LIFE. I AM CURED.AMAZING I DIDN’T THINK IT WAS THAT EASY!!!!”<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what happens when you give people who aren’t disabled but want the sweet, sweet oppression points too much time to think about what something without an inherent meaning “means”.</p>
<p>Plus in my academic experience a lot of these profs were right-out ableist when they found out a.) you couldn’t shut the disability off, b.) you didn’t act like a disabled person from a Oscar bait movie and c.) you were objectively better at some stuff than they were (and we’re talking something few neurotypical/able-bodied people are able to manage- they get really REALLY jealous and angry and try to “put you in your place”). One of these profs called me an “idiot savant” to my face for knowing more languages than she did; another one said I was “emotionally disturbed” due to my tics and rejected me from a doctorate program because she thought I could never make it as a professor and in fact belonged in an institution. So don’t let the “friendly” attitude fool you- a lot of social constructionist theory is built to combine maximum personal bigotry towards a group of people with maximum public grandstanding of how <i>not bigoted </i>you are towards the same group of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The social model of disability is not supposed to say that impairments don’t exist.<br /><br />That said, my feeling hearing that academic fans of social constructionism are apparently saying it does is Dull Surprise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a lot of people on tumblr use the social model the same way and that’s why I’ve never liked it too much. That and the fact that the Actual People who make decisions about disability stuff often use “impairment” to mean “not abled but not bad enough to be disabled” so I’ve frequently heard “you are impaired not disabled” as an answer to why I don’t qualify for some kind of help. <br /></p>
<p>In general though I am very very sick of “____ is a social construct!” though because it’s frequently used to dismiss actual bigotry in sj discourse now to the point people basically refuse to acknowledge that said social constructs are still plenty good enough for discrimination and brushing off shit.</p>
<p>People seem to think “social construct” means “thing that can be ignored” or “thing that can be easily changed” while not making any real efforts to change said constructs past making posts about how it’s stupid and we should ignore it.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sick of “X is a social construct” because I actually don’t know what it means.</p>
<p>Like, I get that it has something to do with the idea that culture influences how we conceptualize things. But beyond that I really have no idea.</p>
<p>Like, many many human societies seem to have genders. They may differ somewhat in which genders they have – some may recognize two, some may recognize more. Some may be more flexible in what members of various genders can and can’t do without social censure.</p>
<p>But if all the societies seem to come up with something that roughly parses to “men” and “women,” and most people seem to end up falling into these categories, what does it mean that similar genders keep getting “constructed?” That all human societies influence one another, or that there are reasons deeper down why similar things keep getting created?<br /></p>
<p>By the same token, I can parse “sex is socially constructed” if it means something like, “well, in the paradigmatic case we see a whole bunch of stuff that aligns in a certain way, these chromosomes, these secondary characteristics, this range of hormone balance/levels without HRT, etc. But outliers exist and are perfectly natural, so we have to decide how to label them. We do that based on social convention.”</p>
<p>I can parse it when it means “I am trans and on HRT, therefore I am not the paradigm case. Because these characteristics have changed, my sex should be considered to be the one that matches my gender, even though I will never quite match the paradigm case.” That makes sense to me too. (FWIW, someone saying “My sex is still not the sex that matches my gender. I have changed as many characteristics as I can, but that doesn’t mean I’ve changed enough of them to qualify as a member of X sex” would also make sense to me. Both of these seem to me valid ways to interpret an edge case.)</p>
<p>But I can’t parse it when it means this thing some people seem to be saying, “I am not the paradigm case, so therefore without doing or expressing anything, I get to decide what my sex is.” To me that really doesn’t follow.</p>
<p>Society and societal norms are important, and interestingly and uniquely flexible. But there are still sometimes facts of the matter – about disability, about sex-linked characteristics, about various other things – that exist independent of social environment.</p>
<p>I mean, even if Society A makes it easier for a physically disabled person to exercise than Society B, and more exercise actually means more control over one’s body because of relative fitness, the impairment-causing disability is still not a socially invented thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah the sex is a social construct one really makes me angry because like, I have body dysphoria. Telling me my sex does not exist will do nothing but feel like my problems are being dismissed. Like even if we ABOLISHED GENDER AND SEX LABELS it will not do a damn thing for when people mistake my fat bloated stomach as being pregnant and I have a meltdown over it in the middle of kmart. </p>
<p>It’s like we went from “body dysphoria isn’t mandatory for being trans” to “body dysphoria is all in your head and you can ignore it”</p>
<p>People KILL THEMSEVES over dysphoria it KILLS people. But if you even TRY to talk about sex now you get treated like you’re transphobic for mentioning sex exists. </p>
<p>Honestly the more this stuff happens the more I think I should just legit ID as “broken” because no one wants me in their spaces for ruining their narrative. The entire point of me wanting to be in trans spaces at all is because I can’t talk about stuff like this with cis people they basically tell you to go to therapy to “get fixed”! So there isn’t a space for that anymore and it’s just so depressing. At least most of the disabled community doesn’t buy into disability being social only but the trans community is increasingly going there with sex and gender :/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that puzzles me too. If sex is whatever the individual says it is, what the hell is dysphoria?</p>
<p>I mean, I’m generally Black-aligned. WOO INDIVUALITY! But this just baffles me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yah. I have a pretty hard time reconciling the non-trivial forms of social constructivism with the existence of gender dysphoria, or with the strong correlation between gender non-conformance with autism spectrum disorders and other behavioral disabilities.  </p>
