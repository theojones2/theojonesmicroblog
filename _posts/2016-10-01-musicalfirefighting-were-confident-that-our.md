<p>We’re confident that our viewers think this law is utterly preposterous but just in case you’re a total scuz bag, The Daily Show made an effort to demonstrate how silly it truly is.<br /></p>

<p>Yah, I didn’t like that segment either. The Daily Show style on that was not useful in explaining anything about what the legislation actually does or the issues around it.</p><p>I’m pretty much against these laws, particularly this one that does focus on eliminating municipal anti-discrimination ordinances. I haven’t really looked into the particulars of the bit of legislation that the Daily Show was talking about, so, hopefully I won’t blast myself in the foot. But it doesn’t look good.  And it also looks like there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Facilities_Privacy_%26_Security_Act">a lot more in that law</a> than the public accommodations section, and some of those parts are quite troubling on first glance. </p><p>But, when you look at things like the Indiana RFRA that has been back in the news (due to Mike Pence)  there is a weird incoherence in the views of the left on RFRAs. In some cases they support (ie. the RFRA on the federal level that passed with strong Dem support) legislation that is almost functionally identical to the bills that they oppose (the state level RFRAs). But it feels like a lot of people are deciding their opinions on who is proposing the bill, not the substantive content of it. It has in effect a proxy battle for political tribalism. </p>
