</p>
<p>I… wish I could agree, but I’m honestly not sure I can. Because yes, you can “criticize something” without saying “there oughta be a law.”</p>

<p>But what does criticizing mean? What ends is it designed to achieve? Very often, no one knows. And if they do know, they tend to parse to getting someone disgraced or making it difficult for someone to make money, which… well, a lot of people don’t have issues with those things, but I kinda do, because I don’t think people are one thing they did.</p>

<p>If there oughta be a law, then it’s clear what your end goal is, and you know whether you’re achieving it or not. You also know how far along you are, because even if your law has not been passed yet, you have things happen along the way like legislators sponsoring it. You know what challenges are occurring and whether they’re minor wording – everyone agrees this is a good idea but they don’t agree on how it should look – or whether you’re facing a serious uphill battle.</p>

<p>With “you can criticize a thing,” okay. You wrote a blog post. Now what do you want to happen? Are you looking for your post to go viral? Are you looking for a formal apology from a content creator? (Are there particular formulaic elements you require in the apology, such that if they are not included the apology is a “fauxpology?” Does the person you want the apology from know this?) Are you looking for a firing? Are you looking for an especially intelligent hatedom that impresses people with its incisiveness?</p>

<p>Etc. “Liberal feminism” gets lambasted all the time, but at least “liberal feminism” is clear about what it is looking for.</p>

<p>This kind of thing is actually the stuff I think looks reasonable at first and is actually a tumblrism (or better said a neo-Marxist impossible project regardless of platform), not the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “main point” is usually cultural influence, isn’t it?  When you start talking, especially through a medium like tumblr, the hope is that other people will become infected with your preferred memetic viruses and start to think along lines that you find valuable.  Hearts and minds.  You know, the thing that authors in most contexts usually <i>say </i>that they want to do.  <br /></p>
<p>“Concrete” “practical” results (apologies, firings, policy changes) are very secondary.</p>
<p>Which doesn’t render the project frivolous.  Cultural change drives pretty much  everything else, at the root level.  Once hearts and minds have been altered, everything else falls fast and easily.  We’ve seen a whole lot of that in the last couple of decades.  <br /></p>
<p>(…which I guess all translates to things like “looking for your post to go viral” and “an especially intelligent hatedom that impresses people.”  But both of those formulations seem unfair.  Even more than politics, idea-building is the long slow boring of hard boards.  The grunt work of writing essays and sharing thoughts is endless.  It’s a good thing that so many of us seem to find it intrinsically rewarding.)  <br /></p>
<p>**********</p>
<p><b>To be clear:</b> this is all a meta-point about the nature of conversation.  Not an attempt to speak up for feminist media criticism specifically, which, well, at the very least it’s definitely not <i>my </i>project.  <br /></p>
<p>But it’s not like there’s no point to discourse contributions unless you can walk away with a trophy.  <br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eh I think you are descending into vagueness with this reply (Ra Ra Ra). I read <a href="https://tmblr.co/mY7OUHHlpypPMEpXHDqOYYw">@fierceawakening</a> as saying “What does success with a post look like?” We can all say “we are trying to change the discourse” but what sort of measurable effects does that really mean? And once that goal is set, people can ask “is the thing that offended me really worth the reaction I am working to implement?” A law is at least a willingness to take a stand and say “this is the effect I want, and their offense is worthy of it.”</p>
<p>Who knows what you’re getting when you try to change hearts and minds. 99% of the time you’ll get nothing, but even when you’re successful… maybe you’ve worked up a mob and the offender’s house gets burned down. Was that what you wanted? What if some of your allies did want the mobfire, but you didn’t, but your posts were more viral than theirs… who takes responsibility for the mob?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this is what I’m saying. I’m not saying we shouldn’t write reviews of novels we like that include “but I didn’t like the gropey kissing. What was with that?”</p>
<p>I am saying that I feel like… writing blog posts where you excoriate someone’s exercise in free expression and calling that “feminism” kind of debases the concept. </p>
<p>Like, there’s winning the vote and then there’s “I worry for the safety of anyone who swoons over Christian Grey.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>50 Shades of Grey are anti-kink! Why does no one ever remember this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What? Cannot tell from one contextless sentence if sarcasm or serious assertion, and can see reasons for either interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I try never to be ironic.</p>
<p>50 Shades book 1 ends with the heroine leaving Grey because she was incompatible with BDSM. The trilogy ends with Grey giving up BDSM and them having a nice tradcon romance. Along the way we discover his BDSM interest was inspired by a predatory woman who took advantage of him when he was young (for which she is castigated.) It’s a pretty classic tale of “heroine’s innocence saves the dangerous man from his luridly appealing but unhealthy world.”</p>
<p>Compare this to Twilight, it’s spiritual ancestor. Vampiricism and biting are a metaphor for kinky sex. Edward wants some with Bella but worries about hurting her. Bella wants some and says so. After a lot of negotiation, Edward realizes <i>Bella really can handle this</i>, and then they consummate their BDSM lifestyle and live healthily ever after in a kinky/vampire positive relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. I knew that part of the plot was the incompatibility, but not how it ended or what that supposedly “meant.”</p>
<p>Still, I’m not sure how that undercuts my point at all – worrying for every fan of something tremendously popular is weirdly wrongheaded, given that when anything gets that big there have to be multiple explanations for why it appeals to people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally I wasn’t going to say anything, because I didn’t want to derail the post with “that interpretation of <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> is really off”, but then I felt it did tie in to some degree - because at the end of the day, criticism and interpretations of material are going to be highly subjective. Which agrees to your second point of multiple explanations for appeal.</p>
<p>To keep with the current example: I felt <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> was about compromise and learning not to run from your problems. I didn’t get that<i> Fifty Shades of Grey</i> was “Anti-Kink” - I got “BDSM Sex is just like any other form of Sex where it requires communication and often compromise to maintain a healthy, long-lasting relationship.”**</p>
<p>Which is a completely different interpretation of the text than what bambamramran up there listed. But generally I agree with the both of you. It’s fine to say why you didn’t like something, or why you think a book leaves a bad message, but ultimately people are allowed to make their own conclusions about materials, and they may vary from yours.</p>
<p>**I stuck my justifications for this sentence under a cut, in case you don’t want to read a long interpretive post about <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>. That I have read, and honestly didn’t hate.</p> <p class=""><a href="http://greyliliy.tumblr.com/post/152123477726/fierceawakening-bambamramfan" class="tmblr-truncated-link read_more ">Keep reading</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was the impression I had of the story, but as I mentioned earlier I hadn’t read it, so I couldn’t say how it ended. </p>
<p>That’s actually the one thing that sounds appealing to me actually – stories about vanilla people and kinky people having to come up with relationship compromises because of their incompatibility is interesting to me.</p>
<p>In fact, every now and then I consider maybe reading 50S, just to see how something famous handles that incompatibility and whether it’s at all interesting.</p>
<p>But I guess I want to be brainwashed into being abused if I have any interest whatever…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See, I’m looking at this, in the context of the original argument, and my original reading of it (that most crit, off tumblr, is just conversation, even if its conversation that you hope might be persuasive, and not necessarily something that you hope will provoke a specific action) and I wonder, if what’s happening is a <b>conversation styles problem.</b></p>
<p>In academia there’s an understanding that everything is stated in the declarative, even when you’re totally accepting that multiple interpretations are equally plausible, or equally valid or etc.</p>
<p>So if I’m writing an academic article, or a fan meta, which borrows many of the conventions of an academic article I say:</p>
<p>50 Shades of Grey is a fundamentally anti-BDSM story.*</p>
<p>But what everyone understands I mean is:</p>
<p>It is my reading/opinion that 50 Shades of Grey is an Anti-BDSM story in light of evidence X Y Z from the text interpreted in light of theory A1.0.</p>
<p>and then other people come in state various things based on theory A1.2 and evidence M N O and etc. And its fine, because we all understand that we don’t have to make the long unweildy disclaimer, because its implicit.</p>
<p>When you take that into a different conversation space people start using it wrong. So that </p>
<p>a) The implicit “my reading is that” gets lost, and people read it as opposing other arguments or attempting to invalidate other readings, or</p>
<p>b) they actually are attempting to invalidate some other reading or</p>
<p>c) they drop the ‘in light of literary theory’ and start taking everything in the context of real life behaviour and become irritating Tumblr antis</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>…. uuuugghhhh, this seems difficult to resolve and annoying</p>
<p>*I haven’t read it, I haven’t got an opinion, I’m borrowing from the earlier posters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m fascinated by the path that this post took.</p>
<p>It started out on the thesis that, without a clear and measurable endgame, analysis and assessment of fiction is ultimately fruitless, regardless of the lens under which it is examined.</p>
<p>From there, 50SoG was mentioned in an example of what, under that thesis, should not be done, and the next 6 additions, 3 of which were from the OP, consisted almost entirely of conversation about whether an anti-kink reading of the text is viable.</p>
<p>To bring the conversation back to the original point, what are you (by which i mean <a>@bambamramfan</a>​, <a>@greyliliy</a>​, and <a>@fierceawakening</a>​) hoping to achieve with your discussion of 50SoG?</p>
<p><a>@fierceawakening</a>​, what are you hoping to achieve with your OP? You criticized the linked post’s standpoint, raising some interesting points, among them the idea that criticism without a concrete goal is useless at best and harmful at worst. If that point is to be taken as correct, and you can be assumed not to have knowingly taken part in the very pattern against which you spoke out, then you must have had such a concrete goal in raising it.</p>
<p>I would suggest that criticism and critique of fiction is functionally identical to critique of an essay by a teacher; it serves to influence future work such that it will be more to the reader’s liking. The key differences are that rather than a 1-1 communication such as in the case of the essay, the conversation is between any audience member who wishes to speak and any potential content creator who happens to hear.</p>
<p>The goal of an individual criticism, then, is to contribute to a conversation in the hopes that it will be heard by more and more future creators and gradually shift the media landscape to a position more to the liking of the person writing the criticism. Regardless of whether the criticism is more along the lines of “this perpetuates rape culture,” “this panders to SJWs,” or “the lighting was too dark and I couldn’t tell what was happening,” the goal is the same: to eventually have more media that the critic likes and less that they don’t.</p>
<p>In the specific case of critique through a feminist lens, that media shift serves the even larger goal of lessening and eventually eradicating the gendered ways that society harms all of its members, but the criticism and critique of fiction is intended first and foremost to contribute to the shift itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>


<p>What I am saying with my OP is that I feel that a lot of “feminist critique” actually is “a tumblrism,” because it does a very common thing that a lot of tumblr does: gives people the satisfying feeling that they have done something to change the world or alter the society, when actually they have not done anything concrete. </p>
<p>Hence my post, pointing out that if you actually say “there oughta be a law,” you are doing something concrete (at least if you actually work to pass legislation, anyway.)</p>
<p>This is one of my major problems with SJ on tumblr. But more important than my specific opinions on activism:</p>
<h2><i><b>that is my problem with RECOMMENDING this course of action as “something that looks like a tumblrism but actually isn’t.”</b></i></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>A few things:</p>
<p>1) I think there are metrics one <i>could</i> use to see how media criticisms affect the media that gets produced, instead of things like “cultural influence” and “changing hearts and minds” that (unless you’re a really experienced pollster or social scientist) are impossible to put numbers to, and vary wildly based on identity, geography, culture, life experiences, etc.</p>
<p>For example, one could find loads of statistics that show how many women are portrayed in media (movies, TV shows, books, etc.) in comparison to men; how many women are directors, writers, and producers are in the industry in comparison to men; what kinds of women get portrayed more often (e.g. age, looks, occupation, sexual situations, etc.); how many women win literary or other prizes in comparison to men; how many women literary critics there are (and how books written by women authors are rated in comparison to those written by men); how many Hollywood films pass the Bechdel test each year; etc. (The <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fseejane.org%2Fresearch-informs-empowers%2F&amp;t=OTg0ZWI2NDgwMjg3M2E4MDc0ZWRlNjkxMTQ4NmYxNmMwOGE2M2I5MixzeWFuVnloVQ%3D%3D&amp;m=0">Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media</a> seems to be a good starting place for this kind of data.)</p>
<p>If one were curious to see how SJ-based criticism is changing the media environment, they can observe how these statistics change over time. We would start to see representations of members of different groups become more equitable, or at the very least more representative of the population as a whole. And if these essays and “hot takes” aren’t moving the proverbial needle (which is not going to happen over, say, a five-year timespan – this kind of change is gradual and takes time), then it would become necessary to try other tactics.</p>
<p>(Which would be fine if it weren’t exceedingly difficult to pressure content creators to be more representative and less reliant on ~problematic~ tropes. The vast majority of media is created by private entities, not all of which are beholden to shareholders, and none of which have to make media that conforms to what fans or other consumers want. Boycotts and “make sure to give this thing money” campaigns only work with consistent large-scale participation, which is very hard to coordinate. Other campaigns all too often only serve to make people <i>feel</i> like they’re doing something important, without ensuring that what they’re doing is being seen by the movers and shakers they’d like to convince. I’m not saying working toward better media representation is impossible, just that building effective strategies in doing so is not going to be easy.)</p>
<p>(Oh, and it doesn’t help that a lot of what passes for SJ-based criticism is sensationalist clickbait, which only serve to create Internet drama and make people less likely to consider more well-argued, even-handed analyses.)</p>
<p>Obviously the metrics I mentioned above are far from perfect, and much of what counts as “progress” and “good representation” is subjective. All I’m trying to say is that you can indeed measure cultural change with cold hard numbers.</p>
<p>2) I tend to think critiquing individual media properties from an SJ perspective isn’t as effective as analyzing common tropes and trends in the aggregate. One piece of fiction isn’t going to make the average person more likely to engage in violent or “oppressive” behavior, or even in more symbolic harms; things like <i>American Sniper</i> are more the exception than the rule. But a lifetime of consuming all kinds of media with particular messages, inadvertent or otherwise, is going to affect how one sees themselves and their place in the world. (Think of studies like <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2012%2F06%2F01%2Fshowbiz%2Ftv%2Ftv-kids-self-esteem%2F&amp;t=Yzk1ZmY4MDJlNGI3NTc5MTAyMTZmYzcwZGFiODZlYWE4Y2ZiYjQ0MixzeWFuVnloVQ%3D%3D&amp;m=0">this one</a>, and how regular TV watching boosts some people’s self-esteem and harms others’.)</p>
<p>So I suspect the kinds of media criticism talked about in this thread is a kind of failure mode – critics begin reviewing individual pieces of fiction with this in mind, observing how they contribute (or don’t contribute) to overall trends they’re trying to change, but they start focusing so much on these individual properties that they stop viewing them as instantiations of a cultural trend that’s causing harm, and more that each piece of fiction <i>themselves</i> will make people more likely to be *-ist, think cruelty is cool, or have lowered self-esteem. (And it’s this kind of thinking that leads to antis being a Thing™, as I touched on yesterday.)</p>
<p>To her credit, Anita Sarkeesian is trying to do this kind of aggregate criticism, at least from the few videos of hers I’ve seen. Then again, she has the tendency to point out the tropes she’s criticizing without considering the context in which those tropes are justified, and ignore video games that don’t fit the narratives she tries to construct. Thus, it’s very easy to read into her critiques that “problematic” tropes shouldn’t be included in media no matter what, context be damned. (Which not only fueled The Hashtag That Shall Not Be Named™, but also a lot of antis’ arguments.)</p>
<p>3) Even then, labeling media as “feminist” or “anti-feminist” (or other such labels) is <i>highly</i> subjective. One person can write an essay detailing all the things that make, say, a particular TV show “progressive” or “feminist,” while another can argue said TV show contains tropes that make it the opposite of those things. Worse, I’ve seen very few analyses that include multiple perspectives; almost everything seems to either praise or excoriate something, never both.</p>

<p>What’s very interesting to me about this reply, nermal, is that what you’re saying about “winning hearts and minds” not being quantifiable is actually exactly my point. The issue for me is that if we don’t have something even vaguely quantifiable to show for what we’re doing, it’s hard for me to see how it’s “not tumblrism” – that is, why it would be worthwhile, rather than masturbatory. <br /></p>
<p>I mean, masturbation’s fun, but when all we really know we have to show for it is that sometimes we get mean and hurt people, maybe we should wonder if we’ve had too long a wank?</p>
<p>That’s my concern with this. I feel like a lot of the posts I see that are pro-feminist critique are almost like… well, to me, they come off as PR jobs. Like that post was trying so, so hard to explain that the thing it does isn’t <i>hostile at all, at all, no no, <b>why would you think that</b>, shh shh,<b> settle down, sweet child. </b></i></p>
<p>Except that right at the beginning, it gave away its contempt with the way it was all like “yeah people are weird and stupid and just assume you said there oughta be a law lol pfft.”</p>
<p>It’s like, well, it’s like. “You heard this thing happened, but it’s lies, all lies.” Why? When?</p>
<p>And the people that are trying to spin this stuff as a good social project are much better at just talking like nothing ever went wrong, and being convincing.</p>
<p>And that frustrates me. Because like… I tried to say “Wait, there’s nothing measurable to show for this. Or at least no one points to it. Maybe there’s some snake oil to the way this is put forward. Maybe if we are looking for a worthwhile project, this is not it, and we should think about what it actually is.”</p>
<p>And everyone’s been absolutely excoriating me for saying it, like there is no chance I could actually have a point.</p>
<p>And that thing that people are doing? <b><i>Is my point.</i></b></p>
<p>Is that this has become sacred, and the minute you ask why, people are thinking you said “no one is ever allowed to say there was a sexist scene on tv last night.”</p>
<p>Which is not what I am saying. </p>
<p>I am saying that the project of combing through media for “tropes” or for “problematic things” is, from what I’ve seen, as likely to trigger scrupulosity and guilt people into giving up security blankets they need as it is to influence a rich movie maker to create the next Furiosa and give everyone feminist yays.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>What’s very interesting to me about this reply, nermal, is that what you’re saying about “winning hearts and minds” not being quantifiable is actually exactly my point.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I said that because I was agreeing with you! All I was trying to argue was that there <i>are</i> quantifiable measures that exist.</p>
<blockquote><p>I feel like a lot of the posts I see that are pro-feminist critique are almost like… well, to me, they come off as PR jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. To me, sometimes it feels like the people writing them are blatantly and cynically gunning for jobs in journalism, punditry, or some other aspect of media. Which is probably uncharitable, but if it were true in some cases I wouldn’t be surprised.</p>
<blockquote><p>Like that post was trying so, so hard to explain that the thing it does isn’t <i>hostile at all, at all, no no, <b>why would you think that</b>, shh shh, <b>settle down, sweet child. </b></i></p></blockquote>
<p>Excellent point. I absolutely <i>loathe</i> it when Bad SJ™ people dogpile on content creators for media they deem racist, misogynist, etc., then when said creators have a natural knee-jerk reaction, the Bad SJ™ folks go, “We weren’t being hostile at all! We were just pointing these things out to you, and doing it in a very calm way! If anything, <i>you’re</i> the one being hostile because your assumptions that we’re being hostile are based in racism/misogyny/etc.!”</p>
<p>And if you actually read what the Bad SJ™ folks are saying, much of it isn’t necessarily <i>hostile</i>, but a lot is very strongly-worded and coming from places of hurt (performative or otherwise). If you’re the one getting dogpiled, it’s natural that you’re going to read this as hostility.</p>
<p>It’s the same kind of … not “gaslighting,” but the kind of Big Lie™ you were talking about after the U.S. vice presidential debate happened.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I completely agree with you on this, and I’m sorry if it seemed like I didn’t.</p>
<blockquote><p>Because like… I tried to say “Wait, there’s nothing measurable to show for this. Or at least no one points to it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Very uncharitable thought: Maybe that’s the point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, you get it. I was beginning to wonder if I’d gone nuts (until I Skyped a friend, who told me she understood what my OP meant, and I heaved a huge sigh of relief.)</p>
<p>(This may in part be a me thing. I’ve been gaslighted before and I have a marked tendency to get into a pattern where even if I remember saying something clearly and charitably, I must 1) not have done so actually and 2) have been mean, even if I do not remember mean intent. Sometimes when something like this happens I’ll go back and look at the original thing and go “wait, I wasn’t mean/stupid/confused/misremembering feminism at all!”) </p>
<p>And having felt crazy earlier today leads me quite directly into:</p>
<p>It does feel to me like the same Big Lie thing. Like if you don’t point it out, no one notices, but if you do point it out, people look at you funny. And it’s like “wait, shit, did I MAKE THIS UP? Am I ‘a fish,’ ‘not seeing water is wet?’”</p>
<p>And I kind of think it’s set up that way for a reason.</p>
<p>Like maybe not that anyone <i>intentionally set it up</i> that way, since SJ is very much a decentralized group movementy thing. </p>
<p>But that it coalesced that way for optimal meme survival, and that optimizing isn’t kind.</p>

Trump can imply that Obama likes terrorists, but when called on it fall back to the literal parsing.</p><p>A lot of the SJ media criticism feels similar in this way. The literal, most narrow parsing of the statements are trivial and harmless. But there is a much stronger subtext there.   </p>
