<p>I’m getting tired of seeing all these memes purporting supposed examples that “prove” that an opposing side has double standards, while ignoring the fact that the two examples given are different in about a hundred ways and shouldn’t be compared on only one axis.  For instance, “the Republicans criticize Obama for not being tough enough with our enemies, while they cry about questions being ‘too mean’ at their debates”, or “Republicans are up in arms about ISIS, while Democrats are up in arms about men not being allowed to pee in women’s restrooms”, or “an athlete not standing for the national anthem is attacked as unpatriotic, while… whatever unpatriotic-sounding thing the Republicans are doing or the Trump campaign said which we’re going to use as a comparison today”.</p>
<p>This extends beyond memes, of course.  In serious political discussions, I often hear things like “how can liberals be against the death penalty while being for killing the unborn?”  As if the only relevant axis for these two positions is “pro-life” vs. “pro-death” rather than something like, say, personal responsibility vs. sympathy for circumstances, or moral judgment ordained by God vs. individual human autonomy.<br /></p>
<p>This may be a bit of a silly connection, but I’m reminded of comedians like Jerry Seinfeld who poke fun at these supposed contradictions in human behavior (in more superficial contexts, of course).  
“We’re constantly going to beaches, pools, lakes, rivers,
 we’re swimming, we’re snorkeling… We can’t get enough water, unless it rains then 
we’re like, ‘Oh, look I’m soaked. I am literally drenched.’…” [from <i>Seinfeld</i> S5 E20]  Yeah, it’s amusing to consider things like this, but nobody would actually suggest that being pro-water with regard to water sports but anti-water with regard to getting caught in the rain is an example of a double-standard when it comes to common stances on water issues.<br /></p>
