<p>This seems like a bad idea. I would rather that obsolete browsers that can’t support new security protocols be taken out of production instead of worked around. I don’t want the security on my computer reduced because some idiots still run IE 6 or something. This sounds like it could weaken security for everyone else that doesn’t run old shitty browsers just as obsolete “export grade” encryption from the 90s is causing trouble today. Security issues with a cryptosystem now mean even worse ones later. We have been through this with WEP, ssl3, and so on. </p>
