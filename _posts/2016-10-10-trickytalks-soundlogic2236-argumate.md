<p>Do you think Vulcan political debates go something like this:</p>
<p>“My policies are a strict Pareto improvement on the status quo.”<br />“Well, I feel that your proof of this assertion lacks sufficient rigor.”<br />*audience gasps, moderator calls for order*</p>
<p>Be gentle, I know nothing about Star Trek.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“My tax policy follows from first principles.”<br /></p>
<p>“Yes but you smuggled in the axiom of choice on line 37 here.”<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I begin to realise that working together could be more conducive to effective governance than this confrontational debate format, and suggest we adjourn.”<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Counterpoint: This debate format is still mostly cooperative, and is almost as effective for policy as more blatant cooperation, while also permitting the discharge of feelings of aggression, the production of entertainment, and that entertainment boosts civil participation.”<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“permitting the discharge of feelings of aggression” waaaaait. so you’re saying that Vulcans would admit to having feelings of aggression? Even implicitly?<br /></p>
<p><a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mj6TW6-svrCEfg8VuCQUAJw">@spookyandroids</a>, back me up here.</p>

<p>The Vulcans are probably as shocked at the behaviour of  that politician as we are at Trump. </p>
