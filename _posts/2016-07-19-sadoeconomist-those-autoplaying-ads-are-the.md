<blockquote>
<p>Those autoplaying ads are the sound of the trumpet heralding doom for this website. Unmute the window again for a minute and listen to death itself.</p>
<p>Now that Yahoo has admitted Tumblr is worthless and is desperately trying to wring some revenue out of it as it dies, the time has come to consider the next move for our community.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a site that will allow us to continue posting with this sort of short-blog format? Should we go crawling back to LiveJournal? Where will we find each other again after this world ends?</p>

<p>Wordpress with the P2 theme (or another micro-blogging emphasis theme)? P2 is a wordpress theme that does tumblrish microblogging.Â </p>
