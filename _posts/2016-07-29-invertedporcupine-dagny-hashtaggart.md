<p>I really hate this condescension of people who support 3rd parties like they don’t understand how elections work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that the best way, and the only guaranteed way, to prevent a Trump presidency is to vote for Hillary Clinton, but this particular example doesn’t make any sense. It’s like saying, “Imagine there are 12 people in your state, 5 vote for Trump, 4 vote for Clinton, but 3 have broken legs due to skateboarding accidents and can’t make it to the polls. Trump wins. No one should skateboard.”<br /><br />I mean, you can create a hypothetical scenario where anything leads to a Trump presidency. Come up with a better argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you can’t reduce the argument of who to vote for to absurdity like that. one of two candidates is going to win. a vote for a third party is a vote that doesn’t contribute to either of those candidates winning. </p>
<p>people who support third parties to the extent of voting for them in a close race where a dangerously unqualified conservative candidate could beat an experienced moderate <i>ACTUALLY DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW AMERICAN ELECTIONS WORK,</i> because we have a recent example of this kind of pig-headed foot-shooting liberal grandstanding, when enough progressive voters made symbolic votes for nader instead of gore that george bush won and kicked off eight years of misrule. had those liberals who voted for nader died in skateboard accidents, sure, george bush would have also won. but they weren’t skateboarding instead of voting. </p>
<p>they went and spent their vote on a useless protest of the two party system, rather than ensuring the candidate that would actually best protect their interests won. it’s not like saying ‘well anyone who didn’t vote for any reason at all is also at fault’. the question is ‘do you want A or B?’ and you can’t have C. you will not get C. we are not even in <i>negotiations</i> to get C. you are going to get A, which is a stale cookie, or B, which is a bag of angry wasps, and if enough people dick around asking for C we are all going to get B. </p>
<p>and hell yeah, i’m being condescending to third-party voters. they’re being deliberately stupid. THIS EXACT, WELL-DOCUMENTED SHIT WENT DOWN 15 YEARS AGO. how can you possibly think we’d get a better outcome doing it again? </p>

<p>boom</p>

<p>And even more to the point. Making a symbolic vote and snubbing the system because you don’t actually ‘think’ that the candidate that you really don’t want still wont get elected is such a bad idea, I don’t even have the words for how BAD it is. This is pretty much EXACTLY what rolled out with Brexit. People made symbolic votes, and essentially ended up cutting off their nose to spite their faces. </p>
<p>That being said, I still want to thwap people upside the head when they state that the Spoiler Effect isn’t a thing. -_- Clearly it is. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, and people keep saying that Brexit Ain’t Us </p>
<p>…but then they go radio silent when we mention Bush v Gore…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you think Gore would have been any better than Bush on foreign policy or civil liberties, you haven’t been paying attention to the Obama administration.  At least with Bush in office Dems had an incentive to pretend to care about civil liberties and some of the violations got press attention.  This was the Democratic Party that had just spent eight years giving us welfare “reform,” NAFTA, and DADT.  As of 2000 the Pepsi vs. Coke analogy was quite apt.</p>
<p>There’s thankfully a substantive split on domestic policy as of now, but with congress as a roadblock domestic policy doesn’t really matter very much.  It required a wave election and a massive mandate to get the piecemeal Obamacare compromise (which, to be clear, was a towering achievement).  And meanwhile Obama is assassinating teenage American citizens for no crime other than those of their parents, and offering no resistance to the NSA’s panopticon, most of which happened while our current nominee was Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s going to support my interests, as a near single-issue voter on civil liberties: pressuring the democrats to come up with a better nominee than a literal war criminal that gives no indication of being any better than fifth Bush term.  For the fringes to have a shot at influencing electoral politics they have to be willing to walk away from the table if there’s an unacceptable candidate.  Cooperate-bots get roasted in iterated prisoner’s dilemmas.  When the dems look like they’re going to stop defecting against their civil libertarian wing we’ll talk again.</p>

<p>My mind’s always getting caught up in this paradox/recursive mode of thinking of voting each time a post like this comes around.</p>
<p>Your vote means nothing. Less then nothing. The probability that even one state will be decided by a margin of one vote is astronomically small. If you know this, then you personally voting or not voting doesn’t make a difference to the result.</p>
<p>But if many people like you think this way, those few thousand votes might actually make a difference, if all those people don’t vote. But everybody’s haggling those other people (and you) already, so maybe most of those will go vote anyways/won’t vote for Your Candidate anyways?? And so you know that your single vote won’t make any difference. But if all those other like minded people think the same … and so on.</p>
<p>In the end, after the counting is done, nobody’s single vote had any influence on the result, and yet if nobody had actually voted, there wouldn’t be a result. The meaning of your vote depends entirely on the decisions of other people and the only way to think about those decisions is that they’re exactly split 50:50 (between the outcomes of “enough people went to vote for My Side to win” and “not enough people did”), because if you had even the tiniest of inklings about how the split went your vote would immediately become absolutely, provably meaningless, <i>regardless of the actual outcome</i>.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to solve this. I tend to err on the side of going to vote for the party I think represents my interests kinda, maybe, some of the time. But I know this is totally irrational, and I can’t fault anybody to instead opt to throw away their vote some other way.</p>

<p>You know who else doesn’t understand how American elections work? People who think all states are swing states, and a vote for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein in NY, DC, or Illinois, or conversely Idaho, West Virginia, or Alabama, is somehow going to Nader this election. If Hillary Clinton is doing so badly that she comes close enough to losing any of the former states for even a few thousand third party votes to matter, she’s fucked. If she’s doing so well that she has any chance of winning the latter ones, Trump might as well concede on the spot. We have this thing called “the electoral college.” You might have heard of it? It makes it so that marginal effects of changing votes in solid states (let’s say at least half of them) are essentially nonexistent.</p>
<p>I get that this is an important election. I strongly support voting for Clinton in swing states, even if it leaves a bad taste in one’s mouth, and if it looks like Oregon has any plausible chance of going for Trump (which it might; it’s to the left of the country as a whole on fivethirtyeight, but not drastically), it’s what I’ll do. But all this ranting about how anyone who doesn’t line up behind her is stupid and evil, irrespective of their location and the actual effect their votes will have, is itself deeply stupid. And frankly I’m not sure how anyone thinks it’s <i>effective</i>. I mean, diehard Bernie supporters on here: would you say the original tweet or roachpatrol’s comment made you more likely to vote for Clinton?</p>

<p>I think the swing state / safe state distinction is actually a mistake, because the map isn’t static.  Colorado and Virginia were safe Republican states in the first few elections I voted in.  Missouri was a swing state.  Now Colorado and Virginia are swing states, and Missouri is a safe Republican state.  <i>California </i> voted Republican in all elections between 1952 and 1988 except for the Goldwater blowout.  One should not be too quick to make assumptions about safeness, <i>especially </i>during an election that may be featuring some partisan realignments.</p>
