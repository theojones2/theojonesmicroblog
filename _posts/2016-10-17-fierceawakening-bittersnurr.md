<p>So this is on my dash and I just kind of</p>

<p>I don’t think the problem is how trans women are treated, I think the problem is how callout culture encourages people to treat anyone</p>

<p>Like</p>

<p>“It’s kind of scary to say this, but sometimes it feels like social justice activist culture creates as many problems as it tries to solve.”</p>

<p>Yes, but not only for people of identity x</p>

<p>“Or maybe it’s just that our solutions, created as they are in reaction to an oppressive society, end up mimicking oppressive systems more often than we’d care to admit.”</p>

<p>Does it matter who we sound like or does it matter what we do?</p>

<p>Also I am pretty sure humans can come up with cruelty independently – I don’t think we are fair until we see unfairness</p>

<p>But that is a question for science </p>

<p>“It’s only very recently that social justice movements have started to discuss how the intense focus that we place on using politically correct terminology, language, and ideas in conversation – as opposed to actually making concrete changes to social and economic practices – can be both elitist and ableist.”</p>

<p>I’m not sure that is recent </p>

<p>What is recent might just be people sticking around instead of leaving or being forced out</p>

<p>And while that painful, uneasy feeling continued to gnaw away at me, on the other hand, I didn’t want to play “<a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/09/playing-devils-advocate/">devil’s advocate</a>” to try and excuse oppressive behavior, did I? I didn’t want to <a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/09/gaslight-people-in-social-justice/">gaslight</a> the individuals who had felt personally attacked or harmed by this person, right by denying their experiences, right? </p>
<p>I wanted my community to be as safe and oppression-free as possible, didn’t I? </p>
<p>And if that meant forcing this “problematic” trans woman out of it, wasn’t that a reasonable price to pay? What other option was there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know the author ultimately decides against this line of thinking, but it’s still <i>scary as hell</i> that it was the first place her mind went. Are there really no options between “push bad behavior under the rug” and “forcibly and publicly eject the perpetrator”? Is it really “gaslighting” to evaluate a situation and decide for yourself who to believe? No. No no no. Never. You <i>always</i> get to think for yourself, even if other people want to dress that up as “excusing oppressive behavior” (as though merely <i>investigating</i> could be an excuse somehow - fucking hell, what do these people think goes on in courtrooms?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In day-to-day interactions, [trauma response] can look like getting verbally aggressive when someone is in your face, like talking loudly and forcefully to make sure that you’re heard, like always being ready for a fight.</p>
<p>In an activist call-out culture, this is read as “taking up too much space,” as “using male privilege,” as being manipulative or behaving unacceptably.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She <i>almost</i> arrives at an acknowledgement that what looks like “male privilege” can actually be trauma-based…and then backs the hell away from it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, she sort of staggers, right at the end, towards the idea that call-out culture, rather than being bad, specifically for trans women is just generally bad, and tends to affect vulnerable people more, as bad things tend to do, but it takes a remarkable number of words to get to that point.</p>
<p>But this also, to me, highlights a specific problem, which she doesn’t mention even a little, which is that SJ culture totally lacks capacity for proportionality of response.</p>
<p>Every single infraction tends to get treated the absolute maximum response, and it leads to this weird thing where, because using an out-of-date term is treated exactly the same and shouting slurs, or coming across as too forceful is treated exactly the same as assault, people start acting like it is the same…</p>
<p>and it isnt’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This. It also fails to distinguish between “feeling threatened” and “actually <i>being</i> threatened”. Which you’d think would be quite important to SJ culture - trans people are being barred from bathrooms precisely because of an imagined threat! Black men are treated with inherent suspicion, again because of an imagined threat! Feeling threatened by someone does not mean that they did anything wrong. They are responsible for their actions, but you and only you are responsible for managing your emotions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly why I am leery of the way that SJ prioritizes “lived experience.” I don’t doubt that sometimes dynamics or communities are not studied and that it’s hard to find data, so “relying on lived experience” is important. </p>
<p>But “lived experience” very often reduces to how things make people feel, and there’s really no way to quantify feelings and talk about whether we are ever responsible for our reactions to things. So it just becomes “someone is hurt” but “is hurt” is never defined.</p>
<p>This is why, counter to most of Tumblr, I actually like the phrase “life isn’t fair.” We absolutely should work to better the world and to right wrongs… but having it in the back of our minds that the world is indifferent to our emotions just because billions of other humans are not us and also have feelings can be a useful reality check.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also like… if your lived experience doesn’t fit their narrative well its not considered applicable by them? Like if my lived experience is “most of my trauma is from stuff from female bullies, doctors, and my mother and not men” I am not supposed to talk about it because it hurts the “women are inherently less dangerous” narrative so I’m not supposed to talk about it. Your trauma must be a certain kind from certain people and you have to respond a certain way to it for them to think you qualify for “protection”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>I ask it over and over, but… does a rich black republican have “the lived experience of a man of color” that SJ wants, or not? He’s lived in skin I haven’t.</p>
<p>If he does, am I obligated to think he’s right, even if my considered opinion is that the policies he supports would hurt his own people?</p>
