<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism—which has for the last 40 years been <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/State_of_the_poor_paper_April17.pdf">enormously enriching</a> the poorest countries of the world through globalization, <i>arguably</i> at minor costs to uneducated white men—is attacked as a selfish, white supremacist system of exploitation.<br /></p>
<p>Interventionist “socialism”, which has characteristically argued for protectionism and redistribution of wealth <i>within</i> rich, white countries, at the expense of raising migration barriers and reducing foreign investment and “outsourcing” (actually, this is presented as a benefit)—is considered the system favored by good-willed cosmopolitans, and is vulnerably only to the charge of possibly being too kind-hearted and soft-headed.<br /></p>
