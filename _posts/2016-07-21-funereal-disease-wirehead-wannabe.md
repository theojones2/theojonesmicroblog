<p><a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mVxjCW87GeqreAA59fWtgPA">@molibdenita</a> - it’s not that I think cheesy summer blockbusters should be held to unrealistic standards. It’s that diversity is just one of many things to consider in criticizing a film, and demanding that everyone rate it as uniformly highly as you do is a step too far. The same person was complaining about the movie’s scores being “artificially deflated” by bad reviews - but it’s not artificial if that’s what the reviewers honestly think! I can appreciate a movie’s diversity and still not find it funny, or find the CGI bad or what have you. <br /></p>

<p>The claim about reviews is more complicated than that. 538 recently did an analysis on movie reviews, and found that men are more likely to give reviews for movies aimed at women than women are to give reviews for movies aimed at men. Since people tend to give lower ratings to movies that are not targeted at their demographic, this means that the aggregate scores will give a misleading impression.</p>

<p>The demographic of this particular film isn’t just “women”, though. Since it’s a remake of a classic, it’s aimed at people of all genders who were fans of the original. It rubs me the wrong way to hear that this movie is “for women”, given that there are plenty of non-woman fans of the original who have closely followed the franchise and anticipated the remake. </p>

<p>Haven’t watched the movie, so, I can’t comment on it directly. But based on the 538Blog article, the changes made during the remake may have very well turned it into the type of film aimed at women.</p><blockquote><p>IMDb <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1289401/ratings?ref_=tt_ov_rt">average user rating</a>: 4.1 out of 10, of 12,921 reviewers<br />IMDb <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1289401/ratings-male">average user rating among <i>men</i></a>: 3.6 out of 10, of 7,547 reviewers<br />IMDb <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1289401/ratings-female">average user rating among <i>women</i></a>: 7.7 out of 10, of 1,564 reviewers</p></blockquote>
