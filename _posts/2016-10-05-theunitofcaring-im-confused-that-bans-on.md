<p>I’m confused that bans on abortion work. The abortion pill is small, it’s not especially expensive, as far as I know it doesn’t expire really fast or anything, it is possible to purchase online, and it’s fairly safe. It seems like at a minimum it should be no harder to get access to than illegal drugs and yes, yes, I lived in the San Francisco Bay, but getting access to illegal drugs is <i>really easy</i>. If I lived somewhere abortion was illegal I would just keep, like, ten in my drawer. Are the penalties for possession draconian? Are pill-induced miscarriages investigated really thoroughly such that it’d be discovered?</p>

<p>I’m guessing a chemical synthesis that is difficult for a basement-dwelling drug lab to pull off safely without difficult to obtain precursor chemicals or equipment or training.</p>
