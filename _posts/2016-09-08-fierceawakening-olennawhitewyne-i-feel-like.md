<p>I feel like at this point I’m automatically uncomfortable with anyone getting angry about “liberals” because:</p>
<p>a) for those of us who live in the United States and were old enough to be paying attention to politics before 2008, it really strongly reminds us of when Republicans used that as a slur-word for not only all Democrats but also anyone who didn’t spend their free time imagining new ways to hate gay people. A lot of where the popularity of “progressive” came from was weaksauce Democrats – <i>not </i>progressive heroes – trying to “rebrand” rather than be like “hey, why do you say that like it’s a bad thing?” It was kind of nice to have that label be a point of pride for a while before a new set of doofuses started demonizing it again</p>
<p>b) so much of the way it’s used on Discourse Tumblr and Radical Twitter and whatever seems to be like shaming people for valuing democratic principles like free speech or freedom of the press or a fair trial or even “people don’t deserve to die for having abhorrent beliefs” over being More Radical Than Thou. Or at least turning up the temperature on that – getting people more comfortable with giving up more democratic things in the name of the revolution. And that’s fucked up. Especially considering that literally 0 of the people I see advocating these kinds of politics online are people who should think they’re safe and comfortable if a totalitarian communist regime came into power</p>

<p>Yup. I support Kaepernick <i>because I am generally classically liberal </i>– because I value free speech and its use, especially in ways that are profoundly confronting but not aggressive. I would support him even if I disagreed with his position and disliked the idea of someone sitting during the anthem (though I agree with him, from what I understand he meant, and I have no problem with people “disrespecting” patriotic symbols.)</p>
<p>Because what he did is <i>exactly the kind of thing </i>protecting free speech rights is about.</p>
<p>I feel like many “progressives and radicals” are less about “this example reveals why free speech is so important” and more about “I happen to agree with Kaepernick. BURN IT ALL DOWN.”</p>
<p>And, er… that’s… not how that should work.</p>
