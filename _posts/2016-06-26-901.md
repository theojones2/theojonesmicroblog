The Financial Times has an interesting article titled “Free and easy admissions leave Vienna’s universities swamped” (sorry, pay-walled) . Austria made the decision to have both very inexpensive, and very open college education after a 2008 reform. This created a situation where the country’s education system is swamped by the influx. And the quality of the education is impacted “None of these students say that they study in [the University of] Vienna for its academic rigor”, and Austria’s schools have declined quite a bit in Europe’s education rankings after 2008. Pretty much easy admissions, and low cost are mutually exclusive options in a college education system. </p>
