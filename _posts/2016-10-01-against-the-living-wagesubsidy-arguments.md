<blockquote>
<p>[S]uppose Bob works at fast-food chain McBurger in a competitive market economy where he gets paid his marginal product, $1/hr. Suppose that he therefore qualifies for government assistance.. Many on the Left would say that the government thereby “subsidizes” McBurger, because McBurger pays Bob less than it takes to keep him living well, and the government pays the difference. But this presupposes that if you hire someone for, say, 40 hours a week, you owe him enough money for him to lead a decent life…</p>
<p>Imagine you argued for the following principle: “If you hire someone full-time, you have to pay that person enough to lead a decent life (defined as follows…), even if that person is so unproductive that you lose money by hiring him.“ That kind of moral codes gives potential employers of the unproductive two options: 1) hire unproductive people at a financial loss, or 2) refuse to hire unproductive people. It forbids the middle ground - help out unproductive people (perhaps even, in the process, helping to make them more productive) by paying them what their labor is actually worth.<br /></p>

<p>Endorsed with that caveat that while <i>this particular</i> argument for the minimum wage is junk, there is the price setting power effect among employers and the fact that the price elasticity of demand for that type of labor is low, so moderate minimum wages make sense (at least as long as there aren’t other sufficient forms of redistribution, and poverty relief). </p></div>
