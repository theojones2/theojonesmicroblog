<p>I’m trying to find a free flowchart generator to help with the code, and all of the top results seem to either A) ask for money (why is this sort of thing scarce enough that you can charge money for it?) B) want me to create an account (whyyyyyy does everyone do this) or C) doesn’t actually do the thing that would make flowchart-generating software more useful than MS Paint (i.e. it won’t let me just enter text and ask it to create new branches, it makes me click and drag text bubbles myself)</p>

<p>Any recommendations or explanations about why the selections are so terrible?</p>

<p>Have you tried dia <a href="http://dia-installer.de/">http://dia-installer.de/</a> yet? Its one of the better open source ones. Also, mindmapping tools may also be useful depending on what exactly you want to do.</p>
