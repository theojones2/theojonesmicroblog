<blockquote>
<p>Actually, I think “don’t answer abstract harms with concrete ones” is a pretty damn useful metric for many areas of life. <br /></p>
<p>Someone’s art offends you? I’m sorry you feel that way. Now kindly look away, and realize that your vague sense of personal upset does not justify the concrete, objectively harmful measure of destroying said art or harassing the artist. <br /></p>
<p>The video of that girl threatening to cut off the white guy’s locs is another good example. If he’s harming her by wearing his hair a certain way, then that harm is entirely abstract, whereas backing a person into a corner and threatening to assault them with scissors is a directly harmful act in no way justified by a person’s hairstyle. <br /></p>
<p>Keep retribution proportional. Keep response to slights on the same plane as that on which the slights occurred. <br /></p>
