<blockquote><p>when someone is criticizing you and the group you are in, it’s absurd to try to change the subject by declaring the critique boring and demanding they change the subject to a critique <i>you </i>find more interesting. if someone says “hey, you and your friends keep dumping your garbage in my yard, please knock it off” you don’t get to go “stop making all these<i>boring</i> criticisms! what about our donations to immortality research? that’s <i>way</i> more interesting- is that a useless waste…… OR proof that we’re forward-thinking geniuses?????? discuss.”<br /></p></blockquote>
<p>It feels slightly churlish to say “I’m not Spartacus!” but I guess in the interests of accuracy I have to admit that I have never posted on lesswrong and in fact do not even have an account on the site, I am not in the pay of Peter Thiel and as far as I know have never met anyone who has met the man, I encouraged people to read Phil Sandifer’s <i>Neoreaction a Basilisk</i> because I thought it was interesting, and I’m not on the master list of rationalist blogs last time I checked.</p>
<p>That aside, I’m not trying to change the subject by finding your critique boring, because it really is boring as shit. You are writing a critique of a group whose founder wants to build an AI god and cure death and tear the stars apart etc. etc. and your most substantive criticism is that he might hold Libertarian sympathies.</p>
<p>Phil Sandifer’s book attracted a lot of debate; a lot of people didn’t like it, but at least there was something there to work with, he had a fresh take. Your critique is just identifying people you don’t like because they are not communist and telling everyone not to interact with them. I mean there’s nothing wrong with that as a political technique, but don’t try and tell me it’s interesting or useful in a non-partisan sense.</p>
<p>(People do it to you too of course, label you as a tumblr commie and move on. God forbid that people who have different ideas about politics ever interact).</p>
<p>Being charitable doesn’t mean agreeing with everyone, it just means recognising that people are human and have reasons for doing what they do, even if some of those reasons are not great. It also helps to sketch out zones of agreement, which can be surprisingly large even between groups that are supposed to be ideologically opposed.</p>
<p>If someone asked me to summarise Tumblr Communists it would be misleading for me to say that they all get off on authoritarianism (even if some do!) or that they idolise Stalin (even if some do!) or that they are all dupes of whatever demagogue is enemy of the moment. If I didn’t at least mention something about reducing inequality then it would clearly just be a hit job trying to impress people who already think Communism Is Bad, and hence boring.</p>
<p>I think you can do better, which is why I bother to interact with you at all.</p>

You need to up you paid $hill game and earn some money. For my rationalist posts I get paid by Peter Thiel. </p><p>For my anti-trump posts I get paid by CTR. </p><p>For my pro GMO posts I get paid by Monsanto. </p><p>For every smartass that can see though the shilling there are 100 sheeple. Yes I am a paid shill, and I make more in one year than he will ever see in his pathetic lifetime. I made 50k yesterday attending a Thiel funded rationalist event which went towards my 6th Ferrari. I&rsquo;d send you a picture of my team of butlers, but it won&rsquo;t matter after the TPP passes and I fire them all for cheap overseas labor!<br /></p>
