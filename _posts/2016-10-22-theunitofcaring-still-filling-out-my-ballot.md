<blockquote>
<p>Still filling out my ballot - there are a bunch of judges to research. I considered having a principled rule to vote against retention of judges, because they usually get retained with like 95% of the vote and if it were, in general, closer, then judicial retention elections would distinguish between good and bad judges more without me having to try to read about a dozen people many of whom don’t have campaign websites let alone independent evaluations. </p>
<p>Cigarette tax: yes.</p>
<p>Assisted suicide: yes. </p>
<p>ColoradoCare: probably yes but mostly as a symbolic vote, it seems like it was planned pretty carelessly and I’m a little worried it’d be a disaster and discredit the idea if it did pass.</p>
<p>$12/hour minimum wage: Still undecided. People have pointed out that instead of raising unemployment higher wages might mean companies make working conditions worse or hours less flexible or screen out high-risk employees (like ones with criminal records or ones with nontraditional dress or whatever), and that those are bad outcomes too, if less measurable. </p>
<p>(There’s also the argument that I should vote for a high minimum wage precisely <i>because</i> it will likely result in the outsourcing of jobs from Americans to people who are poorer than Americans, and that’s a good thing. This seems plausible, but voting on that basis feels like failing to cooperate, somehow.)</p>

<blockquote><p><i>“$12/hour minimum wage”</i></p></blockquote><p>I don’t know much about the particulars of the Colorado initiative on this, but there is a $12 minimum wage <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Minimum_Wage_and_Paid_Time_Off,_Proposition_206_(2016)">initiative</a> in Arizona. I voted for it (early voting). My general opinion on this (a long effortpost that is longer is in the works) is that the balance of evidence about price-setting-power type models, combined with the fairly low demand/supply elasticities of labor tend to indicate that a $12 minimum wage is probably beneficial. Although, I wouldn’t support a minimum wage that is much higher than that. Most recent serious attempts to estimate the optimal minimum wage tend to place it at about 40-50 percent of the median wage.  </p><blockquote><p>“mean companies make working conditions worse or hours less flexible”<br /></p></blockquote><p>This happens to an extent, but,  in general, no, because employers have to pay attention to employee morale and similar factors, and thus they have more flexibility over the pay, than the working conditions. </p><blockquote><p>“ screen out high-risk employees (like ones with criminal records or ones with nontraditional dress or whatever)” <br /></p></blockquote><p><b>Yes</b>. <i>Very much</i>. Studies, even in regards to the current U.S minimum wage which is sufficiently low that price-setting-power effects limit the net disemployment effects, show these subgroup effects strongly (with a big asterisk in regards to p-hacking and adjustments for the large number of correlations looked for in these studies) . Minimum wages push hiring towards more desirable employees. Skilled employees are favored versus unskilled, middle-aged employees are favored over youth, unionized employees are favored over non-unionized employees.  See, the following literature review  <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663">http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663</a> “<i><b>the studies that focus on the least-skilled groups provide relatively overwhelming evidence of stronger disemployment effects for these groups</b></i>.” </p><p>I don’t think this is strong enough to fully eliminate the possible benefits of min wage, but its one of the strongest arguments against it. (Gender and race  subgroup effects are more fuzzy but quite possibly present _</p>
