<p>Ok bitch listen the fuck up</p>
<p>I am about to get my cert 2 in agriculture. I just studied for two years about this shit. I live in a dairy town - 70% of my district is dairy. I have lived breathed and worked C O W S for almost 730 days. Sit your uneducated ass down and listen to an expert.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea how difficult this industry is to work in cause animal welfare nuts like you have no idea what theyre talking about? We HAVE to treat our animals with care and respect, not just becuase some dumb bint doesnt understand how cows react to being ill, but because its our job. They feed us. They are our jobs. They are living breathing beasts just like us, and they deserve care and respect.</p>
<p>So lets break down that video, if youll lend me your attention for another five minutes. Cows are not immediately taken away from their mother. They are allowed to stay with their mother for one day, which is when they recive an important immuno boost froom their mothers milk - which will allow them to survive their first few months of life. Before their mother is too attached to them, they are put in hutches, which keep them safe from cold, cars, and predators, which cows cant fight while producing milk becuase all of their energy is used for all their milk. Calfs are being protected the best way we can protect them.</p>
<p>We feed them all the high-cell count milk by the way - which is alot anyway; cos newsflash my veggie-guzzling pals, cows make too much milk for their calf to feed on. Thats why we harvest it. They have a surplus. Growing calves require 5 litres a day, if that. Cows produce 30 litres a day. Thats 25 litres that would be sitting in a cows udder, opening the way for infection (as teat infection comes primarily from teats ducts not closing, becuase theyre still full of milk) and exhaustion, becuase 25 litres of milk is 25 extra kilos hanging between your legs. Not fucking fun.</p>
<p>Also, sexual exploitation? Do you not? Realise that the whole purpose of an animals life, accordig to their very own instincts, is reproduction? No other purpose. Literally none. Cows cant become doctors, or teachers or rocket scientists. They cant. All they can do is eat, shit, breathe, moo and eventually die. When we take the excess milk, we also make that rather mundane 20-year lifespan and make it much cushier. They mature at 18 months, by the way. Not 12. Plus, cows actually dont reach maturity and full growth stages until theyve been pregnant once. Their bones dont finish solidifying until theyve had one calf, which opens the birth canal and helps their pelvis accommodate walking.<br />The whole reason you think that this is them being mistreated is becuase you dont understand that they dont get pregnancy issues like we do. They also have nothing else to do in their lives. Cows have emotions and deserve respect, but they are not people, and the same standards one sets for the treatment of people should not be the standard one expects of treatment of a cow.</p>
<p>Bulls are huge, and will hurt the cow. Always. We artificially inseminate becuase its faster, safer and more likely to result in confirmed pregnancy. It also reduces the occurrence of birth defects. Cows colons are huge. Theyre three times the size of us. An arm going up there is in no way harmful, and actually helps us identify cow health. I guess maybe the reason you think that thats gross is because fisting hurts humans so much. Refer to my previous “cow standards =/= human standards” statement you kinky pricks.</p>
<p>Cows are not emotionally and physically exhausted by milking. Thats it. thats all i have to say on that matter. They are fed, their health is checked on constantly and they are surrouned by a herd or at least a few other cows 24/7. Theyre mentally and emotionally fucking solid, ok? They are usually totally and completely unfazed their entire lives. The only thing that can really stress out a cow is a human worker acting like a dick. Theyre not that emotionally complicated.</p>
<p>Okay. Sick cows. Guess what? Cows cant tell us when theyre sick. This comes from the fact that theyre herbivores. Sickness or injury makes them a target for predators. So they shut the fuvk up and try to ignore it. What champs. But seriously, cows make 0 fuss when theyre sick. Those cranes? Downed cows sometimes dont get enough calcium, becuase their body poured its entire reserve into the milk. So they will lie down, not make a sound and wait for death, basically. The longer shes down the harder it is for her to get up, so we have to pump calcium into her from a bag and hold her up so her legs dont   a t r o p h y   underneath her.</p>
<p>Bobby calves, or male calves, are sold for veal. It is the darkest secret in the dairy industry and we are not proud of it. But their throats are not slit. All cows that are killed for beef are shot in the precise spot on their head that will kill them instantly and painlessly.</p>
<p>Listen, i dont mind if you want to swear off beef or pork or whatever. Fine. You do you. But ask someone whos actually educated on this subject before you attempt to paint millions of hard working people as animal abusers becuase you dont understand how something works, or use that misinformation to try and make people agree with you.</p>

<p>Everyone should take the time to understand where their food comes from, and learn about it from *credible* sources. There are valid complaints to be made about the agricultural industry but most of the time when I see people bitching they’re just repeating crap they heard from people who know *nothing* about the industry or the animals within it.</p>

<p>News flash: people working with animals are generally not monsters.</p>
