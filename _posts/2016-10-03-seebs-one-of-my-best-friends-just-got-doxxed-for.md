post_title: 'Seebs, one of my best friends just got doxxed for (of course) making art other people didn&#8217;t like. They&#8217;re scared, and I&#8217;m trying to help, but I feel so powerless to stop what&#8217;s happening. I&#8217;m ashamed of myself for not speaking out against this sooner, and I know it&#8217;s not my fault, but I&#8217;m just so angry. It&#8217;s so, so hard to not lash out and try to give the doxxers a dose of their own medicine. Someone I care about is in danger, and I just don&#8217;t know what to do. How can I make any of this better?'

<blockquote><p>Might be useful to look into legal options. In general, <b>doxxing is illegal</b>. The people doing it are, in general, violating laws. So, police reports and things. Keep records of any and all harassment which occurs, and so on. There’s probably better stuff on this elsewhere.</p><p>That said, while doxxing is generally illegal, pointing out who’s doing it isn’t. (Doxxing them would be. Identifying their internet identities wouldn’t be.)<br /></p></blockquote><p>Ethics aside, how is doxxing illegal? Certain common techniques for getting information are, sure, but I’m pretty sure there’s nothing illegal about cross-referencing publicly available information in order to establish that account X is owned by person Y and then sharing that information.<br /></p></blockquote>
<p>The intent generally matters. If you release someone’s address as part of a journalistic investigation of their actions, yes, you are fine. If your intent is to, though, harass or threaten them, or encourage others to engage in illegal activity towards them, then you are generaly on the wrong side of the law. </p>
