<p>Some “gems” from the nightmare that is <a href="http://www.alexstjohn.com/WP/download/Recruiting%20Giants.pdf">the recruitment manual for Alex St John</a>, the same dude behind DirectX and WildTangent (as in the spyware, yup).</p>

<p>Jesus fucknuggets, is this real?</p>
<p>Nope, no sexism in tech. Just move along.</p>
<p>No seriously, is this for real? Is this company still around? How do I avoid them?</p>
<p>Shine a bright light on a shitheads. See them for what they are.</p>
<p>Is this real?</p>

<p>&gt;slides about crushing people’s lives and turning them into mindless cogs in a machine </p>
<p>Yes, but how can i make this into how women are the real victims?</p>

You want to shine a bright light on shitheads, you always have a mirror handy.

<p>This is sexist as fuck against women AND men. I mean seriously, this is preferentially hiring autistic men who are in what looks suspiciously like abusive relationships and using those relationships as the actual mechanism of control of the workforce.</p>
<p>Because, yes, there absolutely is a class of women who prey on nuroatypical men with high earning potential. This is a hiring plan to incorporate that abuse into a company’s corporate culture.</p>
<p>Is it sexist to not hire female programmers? Absolutely. </p>
<p>Is it fucking sexist to incorporate gendered ABUSE of autistic men into your plan to exploit your workers? You bet your hat on it.</p>

<p>I noticed that too. It’s like he sees autistic men as slaves. Or computers.</p>

<p>The guy spends his time running companies that write malware (not just at WildTangent, but at other companies), of course, he is going to be a total waste of oxygen.</p>
