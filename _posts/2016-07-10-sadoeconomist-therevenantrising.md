<p>The #Dallas shootings have ushered in a very new world for U.S. citizens. For the very first time, a #drone has been used on U.S. soil to #kill an #American without #trial or charges. The suspected shooter in yesterday’s tragic killings, U.S. Army veteran #MicahXavierJohnson, was, according to police and press reports, holed up in a parking garage and would not give himself up. After hours of what police claimed were fruitless negotiations with Johnson, a #weaponized robot was sent to where he was hiding and blown up, taking Johnson with it. Along with any additional evidence and many unanswered questions about who helped him and what the true agenda was. #LetThatMarinate #4biddenknowledge</p>

<p>Where was <b>Micah’s</b> “due process”? Where was the obligation of the state to follow rule of law? </p>
<p>There is no longer a balance of power. There are no trials. No judiciary. It’s police with drones. Judge, jury, and executioner.</p>

<p>when you kill 4 cops and wound 7 more you’ve have made the decision that your not gonna live to see tommorow<br /></p>

<p>What did you expect them to do?  He had killed five officers, injured others, and told police that he was surrounded by explosives.</p>
<p>Should they have just offered him some candy and kinky requested he play nice?</p>
<p>Get real.</p>

<p>These people think due process is relevant <i>during</i> a terrorist attack but don’t care about due process when it comes to stripping constitutional rights from people on the no-fly list</p>
<p>How do you even misunderstand a basic legal concept like that so badly</p>
