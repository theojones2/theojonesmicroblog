<p>Wow I was just reading the comments section for <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mr_VjRMdGrF-gPcvkpyuSDQ">@slatestarscratchpad</a>‘s new post. LW-rationalism is completely over, guys. </p>
<p>Highlights are “Trump is the most qualified candidate for president since Washington” and “Read Scott Adams and Mike Cernovich, they have really taken on the mantle of LW and rationalism.”<br /></p>
<p>Very surreal experience to be honest, reading this stuff </p>

<p>Don’t read the comments.</p>

<p>SSC has the best comment on the internet.</p>
<p>That said, it hasn’t really been indicative of LW rationalism for a long time.</p>

<p>Damned with faint praise.<br /></p>

<p>Did you know that <i>anyone</i> can comment on a blog?</p>
<p>They don’t even have to be regular readers! Sometimes a piece can get linked on social media or Reddit or something, and then people can just <i>come and comment</i>.</p>
<p>It seems like it shouldn’t be legal, but apparently no one can stop it. What a country!<br /></p>

<p>Although, it seems like the price of the increased popularity of SSC outside of the rationalist community is a rapid decline in comment quality, and quality of discussion. </p>
