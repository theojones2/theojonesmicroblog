<p>A note on why a BIG is within the realm of affordability. Let’s say that you want to set the level of benefits given by the BIG equal to a basic cost of living + cost of health insurance that provides a full set of basic and essential health care services. How much would that be? 25% of percapita GDP (of the United States) is ~$13,000, which is approximately equal to the U.S poverty level for a single adult. The per-patient cost of Medicaid is $5,790 (indicating the cost of a basic level of health insurance) or ~10% of percapita GDP. <a href="http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-spending-per-enrollee/">http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-spending-per-enrollee/</a>   <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6iXDQ2Fz0">http://www.webcitation.org/6iXDQ2Fz0</a> This means a combined cost of ~35% of GDP which is within the range of social spending in many European countries (if other social programs are replaced by the BIG).<br /></p>
