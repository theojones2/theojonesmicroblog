<p><b>Moderator: “[…] You called what you said ‘locker room banter.’ You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?”</b></p>
<p><b>Donald Trump:</b> “No, I didn’t say that. I don’t think you understood what was said. This was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it.” </p>
<p>Hillary: [desperately trying to hold herself together]</p>

I apologize to the American people. Certainly I’m not proud of it, but this is locker room talk.” </p>
