<p>A few people decided to spend some of their own money to emphasize their conviction that violence has no place in American politics. The howls of protest this stirred up on the left are horrifying to me.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is my cynical poli sci student showing, but the other thing that the people posting this don’t seem to grasp is that this was a <i>fantastic PR move</i>. To call $13,000 a drop in the bucket on the scale of campaign spending and donations is to substantially overestimate its magnitude. Meanwhile, it has generated a substantial amount of positive media coverage, likely more than most things that cost ten or even a hundred times more.<br /></p>
<p>I don’t love Hillary Clinton. She’s alienated a lot of the left to various extents through her actions as secretary of state and her statements on the campaign trail, and rightly so: her hawkish foreign policy, e.g., is both morally untenable and likely to cost her some votes. But nodding approvingly in the direction of the people who made these donations, in the process pissing off a few people who think firebombing your political opposition is super awesome, and were never going to vote for her anyway, is probably a pretty safe bet morally and politically.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this was a pretty cynical move for some people, but I also think those howls of protest (the same howls of protest we’ve seen recently in the Steven Universe fandom over the show’s controversial position that killing your political enemies is bad) are very much part of that still-developing Left/Liberal split. </p>
<p>It’s been in progress for a long time. You can see it in the feminist sex wars, in the modern free speech on campus fights, and further back. </p>
<p>Bluntly, there is a historical alliance that is slowly degrading and has been since the 1970s at least, but the degradation appears to be speeding up, and as the division widens, people are being forced to pick sides where they never had to before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The counterargument is that the place was probably insured, and this cash dump is going directly to limit trans peeps’ right to exist (can we already see what the money will be used for). Nothing against gestures of solidarity, but there are such things like a massive sending of flowers or a rally against violence or the like that doesn’t give resources to assholish behaviour. </p>
<p>Also, against the current state of the Republican party, how much good PR do you really need? Perhaps one can estimate whether or not there is still a significant segment in doubt about staying on the Trump Train, but it seems the lines within the party itself have solidified a lot already (also, how likely is this gesture to be overshadowed by whatever Trump has said in the last 24 hours). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One doesn’t have to approve of the idiotic and dangerous adventurism that drives a terror attack such as this to also be disgusted by the liberal desire to appearse Republicans. As <a href="https://tmblr.co/mw4QzhiSNnZ55iziwxArRPw">@misanthropymademe</a> points out, they could have objected to the violence without actually rendering aid to the GOP.</p>
<p>When has liberal appearsement EVER worked for the benefit of their supposed constitutiencies, rather than just to create warm and fuzzy feelings of “bipartisanship” among spoiled rich liberals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think this really classifies as “appeasement” though? It’s a token gesture of token gestures, and the token is actually an important thing, to say “No, we do not support political violence, do not enact political violence for our positions, we will not help you, we will undo your efforts.” They didn’t capitulate to any Republican issue, they didn’t actually give them enough money to <i>accomplish any contested goal they had</i>. Like, if they wanted a new vending machine in the break room, they get enough money for that, but it’s a stretch to say that allowing the GOP office to have a new vending machine in the break room is “supporting fascists”. Saying because someone opposes you politically, they are therefore fascist (they are not, this is not true, even if you think Donald Trump is a fascist <i>the Republican Party establishment hates him</i>) and therefore must be prevented from ever having anything they enjoy or can use in any context is how the entire left side of the political spectrum got taken over by Culture Warriors.</p>
<p>Again, it’s important to repeat how little money this is. It’s fucking nothing. I think that, when it comes to groups and causes that are politically charged, they stop being able to discern how much money something is, and round off any non-zero amount of money moving to or from a Hated cause as being shamefully large and befouling everyone involved, and round off any non-infinite amount of money to or from a Beloved cause to zero. The Democrats don’t do enough for trans rights – but they have spent orders of magnitude more on trans rights than “free money for (people who aren’t actually) fascists”, yet this person felt confident in rounding it off to zero because the fact they don’t have everything they want means nobody is doing anything to accomplish the goals they want and must be shamed into caring.</p>
<p>I don’t blame everyone for making this mistake about how much money is significant, I think most people are picking up context clues from when they hear about it and going “Well, this guy’s treating it as if it were a significant amount, and appears to have domain-specific knowledge, so I have no reason to doubt him.” But the people who start the outrage should know better. </p>
<p>Even if this were a significant amount of money though, I think it would still be a net good. Sometimes, you have to do something that enables a thing you don’t want, in order to maintain a rule system that prevents a lot of things you don’t want from happening. This is why illegally collected evidence gets thrown out in cases even when the evidence proves the defendant is guilty, and certain forms of prosecutorial misconduct can result in charges being completely dropped – we don’t want people who are guilty to escape justice but we REALLY don’t want a legal system that tramples over everyone’s rights to railroad people into assured convictions, and so we have to prevent them from doing that <i>even when the person they are trying to trample really did it</i>.</p>
<p>We don’t want the GOP to win in its goals (well, most of them, there’s probably at least one or two things in that branch’s local politics that are good ideas). But we <i>really</i> don’t want a system where people think it’s okay to commit violence against political actors in order to stop their political goals. And to maintain that system, we have to still be opposed even when the political violence is aimed at stopping goals we actually want to stop. We have to say not only “don’t do this,” and not only “we do not support this”, but “doing this is not a good idea to accomplish your end goal, we will make sure it doesn’t do what you want it to.” Giving them money is what makes it so political violence doesn’t just get you stern looks, the goal you were trying to attain is undone.</p>
<p>And, like, I know my politics are not the same as yours, even though we’re generally on the “left side of the spectrum” as it is defined in American politics. You are a Communist because you believe Communism is the best way to accomplish the goals you have; I have most of the same end goals as you but I do not believe Communism is a good way to accomplish them, and think that a “center-left-libertarian-ish” model is the best way to accomplish them because really complicated problems don’t have elegant solutions and one answer won’t be the right response to a whole bunch of questions so the thing that produces the best result is probably going to be a weird mishmash of a bunch of different approaches. But for both of us, our political stances have this huge problem of being taken over by popular people who think that political stance is the best way to accomplish their goal of feeling good about punishing the unpopular. So if the American left does a bunch of stuff focused on feeling good about what fair and equitable bipartisan people they are, then as far as I am concerned, that is <i>still</i> a step up, because the “punish the unpopular” praxis wasn’t doing anything MORE to stop harms, and was committing more harms itself. </p>
