<p>I kind of wish he or anyone big in the media would bring up that online feminists said it first, about men and why they felt “not all men” is bad.</p>
<p>Not that I’m an antifeminist, but I do think online activists need to think harder about our rhetoric.</p>

<p>Jesus, this. Ever since the whole Skittles controversy started I’ve been searching high and low for someone to bring up the nearly fucking identical M&amp;M analogy. I mean, that’s what I immediately thought of the second I saw that tweet. It’s just kind of bitterly ironic that there’s all this (rightful! Don’t get me wrong!) outrage over Donald Trump Jr.’s use of the analogy when the feminist use of the analogy goes largely unquestioned. And now we’re supposed to hate it because the wrong group is using it?</p>
<p>Sure, there’s of course the fact that it’s <i>dramatically</i> more likely that a woman will be raped (or just abused in general?) by a man than it is that a Syrian refugee would turn out to be a terrorist, but it’s more the logic of the argument that bothers me. Because in both analogies, we’re talking about <i>people</i>, not fucking <i>candy</i>. And while in <i>both</i> cases I think it makes sense to be afraid - or, at the very least, I don’t blame people for being afraid - when you make actual, practical decisions about what to say and do in response to that fear… you gotta remember that your decisions affect real, actual, people. Not imaginary candy.</p>

<p>A few places have reported it, but Iirc they’ve tended to be conservative outlets. One was Breitbart.</p>
<p>It saddens but doesn’t surprise me. I would have hoped the left would take responsibility and say oops, we enabled this.</p>

<p>Such is the sad fate of political discourse. Most of the time it’s not about being right or wrong or doing good in the world. It’s mostly about not being the other side. So of course The Right will lambast The Left for this, b/c it’s a golden opportunity to attack their opposition. And of course The Left will never acknowledge it, b/c doing so would cede ground to The Right, and that is inexcusable.</p>
<p>So instead what we get is another example of There Are No Bad Actions, Only Bad Targets.<br /></p>

<p>A-yup.</p>
<p>I keep hoping the SJ bubble will break, exploding the worst of the bad stuff and leaving sensible people and a reasonable Overton window that doesn’t have, like, telling people to die in it.</p>
<p>But I’m honestly no longer sure that will happen.</p>
