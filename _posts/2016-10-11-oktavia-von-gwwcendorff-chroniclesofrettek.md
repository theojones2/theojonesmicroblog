<p>Seriously, do Bernie or busters backing Johnson really NOT understand what libertarianism is?? It’s the exact <i>polar opposite</i> of what Bernie is proposing.<br />It promotes personal liberty and <i>heavily</i> minimized government<br /></p>
<p>Seriously, little to no government intervention, total laissez-faire capitalism, which means NO regulation of wall street, NO universal health care, NO tuition-free college, NO gun control, NO federal protection for LGBT or female workers from harassment, Little to NO taxes meaning it’s harder for infrastructure of schools to be funded etc.</p>
<p>It’s like, say Elizabeth Warren voters going to Reagan or Ron Paul basically, it makes no logical sense whatsoever</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This confuses me too. Libertarians backing him doesn’t, obviously, but the whole idea of Bernie fans backing him leaves me ?????</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I voted for Bernie in the primary and I’ll most likely vote for Johnson in the election. </p>
<p>1. This is factually incorrect about gun control positions. Sanders was the softest on gun control that a Democrat could possibly be, merely calling for a federal level closure of “the gun show loophole”. This was actually an important part of his platform for me, and culturally signaled important information too.</p>
<p>2. I’m actually kinda iffy on both of their economic plans.</p>
<p>3. I mostly am sick of “mainstream politics” that feeds the party machine and doesn’t actually reflect the voters.</p>
<p>4. I’d have a hard time choosing between Sanders and Johnson if they were the two leading candidates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sanders was soft on gun control, yes, but from what I saw it was the one thing that liberals and progressives DIDN’T like about him. So it would be one of the few things “BernieBros” would likely not have seen as messianic about him.</p>
<p>There are definitely some anti-gun control liberals, such as yourself. But there are not many.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, it’s not so hard to explain the Bernie-or-Busters who are supporting Johnson now: deep down, Sanders’ fiscals proposals were never what they cared about; they just liked the idea of supporting someone “outside the system”.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve seen this a few times in the media now. “Bernie and Johnson are opposed on <i>every</i> issue!! Why do Millenials like both of them??”</p>
<p>Here’s one issue they agree on, an issue that NO other major party presidential candidate has EVER taken their stance on: Government surveillance. Specifically, they are <i>against</i> it.</p>
<p>It pisses me off that so many commentators have no idea this issue even exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Against government surveillance and foreign wars. Basically the first things you hear about when you ask someone outside the D-R binary about what they care about, and basically one of the places that Trump and Hillary agree. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Seriously, do Bernie or busters backing Johnson really NOT understand what libertarianism is??</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh yes I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s the exact <i>polar opposite</i> of what Bernie is proposing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I did have some severe reservations about Bernie’s economic policies but his other stuff seemed comparatively worthy.</p>
<blockquote><p>It promotes personal liberty and <i>heavily</i> minimized government<br /></p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly, that’s precisely what I want.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seriously, little to no government intervention, total laissez-faire capitalism,</p></blockquote>
<p>-&gt; less corporate welfare etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>which means NO regulation of wall street</p></blockquote>
<p>how well did it work last time? parasitical banking basically exists thanks to government aroundfucking in the economy, the government ain’t going to kill it dead with regulation, but deregulation might at least let people build alternatives without getting pwned by existing powers using the state to pursue their own interests</p>
<blockquote><p>NO universal health care</p></blockquote>
<p>the government is what made the healthcare so expensive, I don’t trust the government to be able to fix that; just look at what has happened to obamacare</p>
<blockquote><p>NO tuition-free college</p></blockquote>
<p>just abolish the prestige-industrial complex and its parasitism already, let education be free as speech instead of beer etc. and don’t throw endless money to the bottomless pit; tbh the same applies to healthcare too, people are spending way more than they should be because they can pass the costs to others through dysfunctional institutions like insurance companies (regulated to hell) and badly-designed public funding</p>
<blockquote><p>NO gun control</p></blockquote>
<p>for all you guys mock it, there’s a reason why the single most powerful superstate in the world shouldn’t be able to be an unchallengeable sovereign; it’s just elementary</p>
<blockquote><p>NO federal protection for LGBT or female workers from harassment</p></blockquote>
<p>the State didn’t give us human rights; at best it stopped actively seeking to take them away; the State SHOULD NOT BE DECIDING RIGHTS because it never ends well</p>
<p><i>our own activism</i> is what we defended our rights with, the state just caught on when it realized blue-tribers give free votes to authoritarian cronycapitalists for waving rainbow flags around</p>
<p>(yeah that’s right, the not!state was into gay rights before it was cool)</p>
<blockquote><p>Little to NO taxes meaning it’s harder for infrastructure of schools to be funded etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>little to no taxes meaning people have more money to fund such things themselves, less distortionate losses in the economy where worthy jobs go undone because tax wedges render them unprofitable, <i>less money to imperialist militarism and the panopticonian dystopic dreams of the party machines</i></p>
<p>why the fuck do socdems always assume everyone else <i>Must Obviously Be A Socdem Too</i>?</p>
<p>or that everyone else is <i>Definitely Willing To Excuse Continuation Of Hellish Authoritarianism As Long As They’re Thrown A Few Economic-populist Bones Every Now And Then</i>?</p>
<p><b>TL;DR why is this fucking baby-boomer socdem dude telling me what millennials should actually want?</b></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>“why the fuck do socdems always assume everyone else Must Obviously Be A Socdem Too?” </i><br /></p></blockquote><p>Because the person you were responding to was talking about berners who decided to support Johnson in the general election and because Bernie is pretty much the American equivalent of one (with a nice dash of anti-immigrant protectionist xenophobia added in). </p><p>I can get why someone would support Johnson. I can get why someone would feel the Bern. I have a hard time figuring out a coherent political position that would result in Bernie being the first choice and Johnson being the second choice (aside from single issue voting on one of the few issues where they actually agree) . Their platforms are just <i><b>very</b></i> different. </p>
