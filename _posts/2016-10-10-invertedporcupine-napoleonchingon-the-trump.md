<p>The Trump tapes thing has definitely made me more pro-feminism in that a significant number and portion of people are trying to defend Trump by saying “what? that’s what every dude says and thinks!” And to the extent that that’s true, then feminism’s point about rape culture seems pretty correct.</p>

<p>The idea that Trump’s behavior is actually reflective of a majority of men, rather than a subset of horrible men who have something in common with Trump, is pretty friggin offensive to the actual majority of men.</p>
