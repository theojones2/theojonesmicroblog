<p><strike>They had me at “beware male feminists” and lost me at “beware men who value objectivity over subjectivity

”. </strike></p>
<p>Seriously speaking tho, the lack of self-awareness in that article…</p>
<p><i>&gt;

Beware men who use examples of their oppressed intersections to invalidate your arguments.

</i></p>
<p>when just before it said:</p>
<p><i>&gt;

Beware men whose first words when you relate your lived experience are “well, actually” or “not all.”

</i></p>
<p>and afterwards it also says:</p>
<p><i>&gt; 

Beware men who swear up and down that “this isn’t about that,” when the “that” is a marginalized identity that you hold.

</i></p>
<p>So… if a man talks about about their experiences as an oppressed person and you disagree… he’s the bad one.</p>
<p>But if you talk about how your experience as an oppressed person and they disagree… he’s <i>still</i> the bad one.</p>

<p>Hoo boy. Also “men who demand to be present in your queer spaces” are we supposed to just know they only mean cishet men? Or are all dudes considered not queer??</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This part terrifies me:</p>
<p>“Beware men who shoulder their way into feminist spaces so they can inject them with male “logic,” “reason,” and “rationality.””</p>
<p>The notion that logic and rationality are male has creeped me out for over a decade. If we say logic and rationality are male, then we are not only saying women are not rational or logical, but that this is a good thing.</p>
<p>That terrifies me, because when you couple claims like that (along with related claims that rationality is white) with the claim that members of that majority need to have less power or abdicate their power, you are saying that you want the ascension of a new powerful class – one that does not use rational argument, discussion, or logic to decide how best to use its power, but feelings.</p>
<p>I don’t want the world to be ruled by feelings, even if they are Woman Feelings. I especially don’t want the world to be ruled by feelings of anger and desire for vengeance.</p>
<p>I want the rational people to rule the world, if anyone has to (and someone probably does.)</p>

<p>K no seriously are we all forgetting what scare quotes mean</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on other items on the list, I am not convinced those are meant to be scare quotes: <br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Beware men who value objectivity over subjectivity <br /></p>
<p>
Their ability to emotionally detach from your lived reality doesn’t make them smarter than you; it makes them more privileged.

<br /></p>

<p>Reason and logic are inherently masculine and women have a more emotional way of knowing? Looks like Everyday Feminism and /r/The_RedPill agree on something. </p>
