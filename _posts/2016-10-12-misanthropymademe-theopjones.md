This seems like it would be better solved with auto-transcription software or the like.

<p>I know this is Old Discourse by now but: If We, the People, feel like this is a thing that should happen, We, the People, should pay for it.</p>
<p>The <i>worst</i> kind of budgeting is the kind that is made like this: “This is a problem, where’s the nearest rich institution we can force to deal with it?” because rich institutions become that way by being good at not spending the money they make.</p>
<ul><li>People cannot live on $x an hour, let us force companies to pay people at least $x+y an hour.<br /></li>
<li>
<i>Oh look, now companies are replacing people with automation</i><br /></li>
<li>Poor people cannot afford houses, let us force banks to loan them money</li>
<li><i>Oh look, now banks are doing all kinds of manipulation to make bad loans look good</i></li>
<li>It is too difficult to find parking in the city, let us force all new developments to have space for at least two cars per dwelling</li>
<li><i>Oh look, now all new developments are hellholes because costs need to be cut elsewhere (A marginal parking space costs $20,000. Yes really.)</i></li>
</ul><p>It doesn’t work. It never works. People think “If people do X, force them to do Y also” and believe this means they’ll get more Y for free. No, you’ll get less X, and the X you get will be more expensive because it also has to pay for Y.</p>

<p>Doesn’t that apply to basically all disability accommodations?  Making stuff wheelchair accessible may have made every building do the X + Y thing, but afaik it’s been pretty successful.    And maybe we do get less X but in that case I think we able bodied people can take one for the team.</p>

<p>Yah. </p>
<p>Although shieldfoss does have a point, even though he goes too far in saying that regulations of that form never work and don’t work. People way too often think that regulatory mandates are a source of free shit because the costs of them are hidden. But the costs didn’t go away, and might actually be more than if the government paid for it directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of note is that I never said who should be responsible for the solution. I think government is often a solution to this precisely because they have at least a bit less incentive to cut corners or shift costs elsewhere, like the examples <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/m4OOu-EBs3RJfMuiEXWOFlA">@shieldfoss</a> mentioned. </p>
