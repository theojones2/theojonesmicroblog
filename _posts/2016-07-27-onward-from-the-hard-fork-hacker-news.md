<p>So we now know that contracts on
 Ethereum mean what they say, unless there is a community consensus that
 the contract actually means something else, and the machine meaning 
doesn’t properly reflect the intent of the parties.</p>
<p>But it is a little
 unsatisfactory to have this ad-hoc method of hard forking. Maybe there 
should  be in future some sort of public process to determine whether an
 action is consistent with the intentional meaning of the contract (as 
opposed to the machine meaning). We could all agree to appoint some 
qualified person to hear disputes and determine whether the code has got
 it wrong and we should fix the code with a hard fork. Let’s call that 
person a ‘judge’.</p>
<p>Now that judge will need to have procedures and 
rules. He or she isn’t deciding on a whim, after all. These rules will 
set out things like what evidence the judge can look at to determine the
 intentional meaning of the contract. Just for giggles, let’s call one 
of those rules the &lsquo;parol evidence rule’. Also, we don’t want anyone to 
be able to bug the judge and waste their time, so we need some rules as 
to who can ask the judge to look at a dispute. I’m feeling creative, so 
let’s call those rules 'standing rules’.</p>
<p>What would be really 
fabulous is if this system could be paid by the taxpayer out of general 
revenue. That way we can reduce the likelihood of the biggest, richest 
investors bribing the judges.</p>
<p>But this is obviously all fantasy. No one would ever build such a system.</p>
