<p>like… I know we don’t do the whole comparing oppressions thing, but a lot of oppressions are at least… shielded? people talk about family values or welfare-to-work or states’ rights or whatever</p>
<p>but with addiction… a lot of people just feel totally comfortable saying they think it’s a neutral or even desirable state of affairs if addicts are subject to human rights abuses or get sick or die</p>
<p>and it makes me scared and sad</p>

<p>Same story goes for pretty much every form of mental illness.</p><p> Stuff that if said about race or gender would be limited to StormFront or r/redpill is A-Ok to say outright in the political mainstream about mental illness. And I’ve noticed that a lot of websites and forums that ban on sight racists and sexists allow open ableism. </p>
