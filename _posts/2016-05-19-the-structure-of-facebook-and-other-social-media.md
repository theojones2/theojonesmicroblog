<p>The structure of Facebook and other social media services is quite malformed if you want serious discussion about complex issues. Here is how design decisions in Facebook encourage shitposting</p>
<ul><li>The “like” and the “share” system (combined with the lack of a downvote mechanism) provides positive reinforcement to people who post low-quality content. There will be a few likeminded people who like the stuff you share, even if it it is disliked by almost everyone else</li>
<li>Long-form content is second-class. While FB isn’t as extreme here as Twitter, its design still makes short posts and image posts more visible. This encourages memes and one liners over actual discussion.</li>
<li>Facebook bubbles users. It gives users what they have interacted with and liked in the past and filters out all of the other posts from their feed. This is done both on a per user basis and a site-wide basis. This limits exposure to opposing views.</li>
</ul><p>The effects of these tendencies on the broader world of political discourse are pernicious. People are no longer using traditional media sources, and are instead relying on social media more and more.</p>
