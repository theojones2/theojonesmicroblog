<blockquote>
<p>I am not sure what regulatory regime I want for the psychedelicsÂ </p>
<p>like, in terms of marijuana: legalize it, encourage advertisement of it, tax the hell out of alcohol, and hope it gets everyone to switch to weed</p>
<p>in terms of heroin, cocaine, etc. decriminalization and harm reduction seem to be the way to go</p>
<p>but I think that it is a good idea for people to take psychedelics, but also that they should be approached seriously and with respect and knowledge and not as a party drug, and idk what regulation would cause that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A permit required to buy them and a mandatory training course before you can get a permit to buy psychedelics?</p>
