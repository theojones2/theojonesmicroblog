<p>also, yes yes yes to <a href="https://tmblr.co/mOrfyG2E212RW8F5jOdhwaQ">@earlgraytay</a> on “the people you’re trying to help are problematic.”</p>
<p>A depressingly noticeable number of poor white disabled people bemoan their lot by yelling about “illegals,” “terrorists,” miscellaneous brown people, and shudder shudder SPANISH SPEAKERS who they don’t understand and who thus must be PLOTTING NEFARIOUS THINGS. Who, they claim loudly and often, steal all the public housing, and act worse than anyone else. Should I refuse to help these bigots when they have serious medical issues, on the grounds that racists deserve to DIAF LOL?</p>
<p>A depressingly noticeable number of the same people, though now let’s include some POC, whee!, think that gay people are horrible and disgusting. Should I refuse to help them when they have been trapped languishing in a nursing facility for years because not even their own family cares about them any more, on the grounds that when they rant like that they are actually unknowingly telling me to my face that I deserve to DIAF LOL?</p>
<p>When you SJers whose activism is all online “call someone out” for “being problematic,” please just recognize that the problematic you are seeing and picking at? Is really minor. Most people who are not wealthy, or well educated, or marinating in a certain academic environment are far, far more problematic than Joss Whedon, or Michael Bay, or even, gaspy gaspy gasp, Steven Moffat.</p>
<p>If you want to make the world better, you need to realize that <i>some of the people you need to make the world better for are going to be people whose views fundamentally horrify you.</i></p>
<h2><b><i>Y’all are picking at low hanging fruit and acting like you’re saving the world.</i></b></h2>
