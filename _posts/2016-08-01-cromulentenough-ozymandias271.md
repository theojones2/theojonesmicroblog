<p>Say that at 18 I slap down enough money so I could have my whole body covered head-to-toe in tattoos, piercings all over myself, a mountain of cigarettes, plastic surgery, and plan to have like 20 babies… but if I try at all to safely make it impossible for me to breed for the sake of my health suddenly its like WOAH THERE SLOW DOWN MISSY YOU’RE NOT READY FOR THIS KIND OF COMMITMENT YET</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have stage III Endometriosis, which means I have to get my uterus removed because I literally have terrible cramps ALL THE TIME and not just when I’m on my period. Now, I’ve always said I don’t want any children for personal reasons and I don’t need my uterus, really. I am not worried about that surgery and I don’t feel any kind of nostalgia over an organ I won’t ever use. </p>
<p>The thing is, my doctor is a ‘man’. This ‘man’ told me I had to get pregnant right now before it’s too late. I told him I didn’t want to get pregnant and explained the multiple reasons but what, do you ask, did my doctor have to say about this? <strong>‘Well, better have a kid now because just imagine how depressing it must be being a thirty-something woman without children and a husband?’</strong></p>
<p>I was diagnosed a year ago. I should have gone through surgery six months ago and I still can’t find a doctor that will perform the surgery without trying to force me to have children first. Basically, <strong>if you’re a woman you don’t have a say in what can and cannot be done to your body without a shitload of people getting in the way AND I’M FUCKING SICK OF IT.</strong></p>

<p>A dear friend of mine wanted to have her tubes tied.  She was about to give birth to twins and the doctors wouldn’t consent because she wasn’t 21 yet.  She had already had children and they still refused to let her have the procedure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My friend got a vasectomy a week after asking his doctor for one, no problem. He was 25.</p>
<p>Me? I’ve asked 4 different doctors for some kind of permanent sterilisation—tubal ligation or Essure or whatever—and I get a pat on the head and a “You’d regret it if you did.”</p>
<p>Oh, DIDN’T REALIZE YOU HAD A DIRECT LINE TO MY BRAIN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is horrifying.</p>

<p>I really hate these type of posts…<br /><br />They make it look like ALL men are just misogynistic pigs who think that women are only fit to breed…. never mind that a doctor has had years of training based on decades of research (yeah yeah i know… research done by “men”)<br /><br />However there is a good reason why doctors don’t just sterilize women…<br />For contraception and even endometriosis you can use other and better types of treatment without being so radical…<br />For instance Mirena (hormonal IUD) has a pearl index (effectiveness of contraception, lower is better) of 0,2 wich makes it the most effective form of contraception while surgical sterilisation only has a pearl index of 0,7.<br /><br />a hormonal IUD is also extremely low risk while surgery never is as in the case of sterilisation there can be severe comorbidities (1/800) and chance of even death (1/8000)<br /><br />Now you can say that you are sure at 21 about the rest of your entire life (which frankly is weird as nobody can see the future)  but observational research has shown that 2% of women ask for the sterilisation to be ‘fixed’ this number rises very quickly as the age at intervention drops. but in only 65-80% the continuity can be restored. 10% of these women will have an extra-uterin pregnancy ( potentially lethal).<br /><br />So you wonder why a doctor would be hesitant to just go ahead and sterilize? <br /><br />- there is a better and safer option that only requires a safe intervention every 5 years<br />- a large amount of women regret their decision afterwards especially if it happened at an early age<br />- If there is a wish to revise the sterilisation,  the success rate of yet another risky operation is not great and can cause big problems on it’s own<br /><br /><br />now why is it easier for a man to be sterilized? really? you need a drawing? <br />To sterilize a man there is hardly a risk, it is more effective, and gives less pain, or needs less time to recuperate.<br /><br />If you want long term contraception… maybe you should talk to a doctor…  and yes then i do mean a doctor whether they be male or female.<br />I’m not saying doctors are infallable but there is a reason they have been trained for so damn long and that is to decide mostly by what research has found and that simply is that surgical sterilisation at a young age with contraception as a reason should not be done because statistically too many women regret it in the end for above mentioned reasons<br /><br /><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If these reasons are the case then doctors are still not respecting women by telling them the risks and benefits. <br />What’s more it’s not that they think we’re only fit to breed its that motherhood is seen as an intrinsic part of womanhood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah I’m calling bullshit because the only reasons I’ve ever heard of doctors ACTUALLY CITING TO PATIENTS is “you’ll change your mind” or “we don’t do that for healthy women your age” or similar. If it was <i>really</i> about risk vs. benefits, they’d say “here’s a less-risky option that has a better effectiveness rating, and it’s reversible if you do change your mind later but you can also keep using it as long as you want”. Age would not be a factor, nor would number of previous children, or disability status (disabled women are more likely to be sterilized against their will, rather than denied a desired sterilization procedure). <br /><br />Also not everyone can have hormonal birth control, like if you have a family history of blood clotting issues it could potentially kill you so yeah, not the great one-size-fits-all option either.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s what I don’t get: why does all this sterilization discourse take place in a world where there’s no such thing as adoption? Like, say these dudes are right, something crazy happens and one of these women decides she REALLY REALLY WANTS TO BE A MOM. Why, exactly, does she need to give birth for that to happen? Can’t she just adopt, or, depending on the circumstances, use a surrogate? It would still be her kid. I don’t get it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was going to say: The doctors are the wrong people to be mad at: blame the women who pursued sterilization, did turn out to regret it, and sued the doctor with the explicit rationale of “I was too young.”.  Blame juries for finding in their favor.  </p>
<p>But then I looked for citations and couldn’t find any- it’s all women suing after sterilization failed, or suing for non-consensual sterilization.  So barring further information, fuck you doctors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are lots of big decisions people can make at 21! For instance, they can <i>have a kid</i>. Any logic that says you shouldn’t sterilize people at 21 implies they definitely shouldn’t be having kids at 21– after all, having a kid that you regret a decade later affects the kid too.</p>
<p>It is not the job of a doctor– who does not know them!– to decide whether or not an adult would regret sterilization. It is the job of the adult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was under the impression that this was because enough people had had sterilisations at young ages and then regreted it and sued doctors. If this is the case, then i blame them and the courts/ juries rather than the doctors. If this is false, then yeah fuck the doctors who do this.<br /></p>

<p>Its my (non doctor, non lawyer) impression that liability risk does have to do with this, but its not patients regretting it and suing. Its more that any procedure has some risk of failure, and the failures that do happen will be judged much more harshly when the procedure involved is non-standard. </p><p>(In the U.S at least) the extent to which doctors are deemed to be operating within the standard of care relies a lot on what the other doctors in the area are doing.  Lets say a doctor does sterilizations, in cases where it is non-standard to do this. Sometimes the procedure fails, but this doctor’s failure rates are within the norm for the procedure. If the procedure were mainstream in those cases his reasonable failure rate would be a pretty good defense if sued by one of the patients where it failed, but the non-standard nature of the procedure would weaken this defense.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Overtreated-Medicine-Making-Sicker-Poorer/dp/1582345791/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470025314&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=overtreated">inverse issue also happens</a> where doctors will sometimes prescribe unnecessary/non-cost effective treatments because the other doctors do in the area, and if something goes wrong than the doctor’s decsion not to issue that 

prescription would be risky. <br /></p>
