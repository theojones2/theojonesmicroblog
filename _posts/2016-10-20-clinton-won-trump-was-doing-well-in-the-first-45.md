<p>Clinton won. Trump was doing well in the first 45 minutes, but then he fell apart. On the tax returns, on the groping question, on the foundation question, on the foreign policy questions, and on the budget questions,and on the &ldquo;will you accept the results&rdquo; question, Hillary was doing well, but Trump was barely coherent and looked really bad. I guess, even when he tries his hardest, Trump can&rsquo;t hold it together for more than 45 minutes.</p><p>And Trump did nothing to turn around the momentum against him, and to appeal to moderates. Even in the first 45 minutes he was base feeding pretty well, but threw few bones towards moderates.</p>
