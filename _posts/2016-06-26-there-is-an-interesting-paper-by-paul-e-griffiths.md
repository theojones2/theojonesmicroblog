<p>There is an interesting paper by Paul E. Griffiths in the journal The Monist titled “<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/27903758">What Is Innateness?</a>“. In that article Griffiths argues that the concept of innateness as understood in many popular writings is incoherent. Namely, he argues that this concept includes all of the following concepts</p><ul><li>Species nature that reflects “what it is to be an organism of that kind, with consequent associations of typicality or universality.”</li><li>The telos/”intended outcome” of the organism ie. “innate traits [that] are how the organism is meant to develop: to lack them is to be malformed” Very normatively laden.</li><li>Developmental fixity — which is the one biologically well-defined and coherent element.</li></ul><p>He claims that the combined concept of innateness is strongly related to folk essentialism , and that “folk essentialism is both false and fundamentally inconsistent with the Darwinian view of species, it should be rejected…… Because ‘innate’ is a common term whose vernacular meaning embodies this way of thinking about living systems, attempts to stipulate a new, restricted meaning for this word are unlikely to be successful…. Therefore, I suggest, the use of new, neutral terms for each of these several properties is preferable to trying to retain the term ‘innate’ for one or more of them“.</p><p>I think this dynamic of folk essentialism has a lot to do with a number of political issues that involve scientific concepts.</p>
