<p>“My body, my choice” only makes sense when someone else’s life isn’t at stake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun fact: If my younger sister was in a car accident and desperately needed a blood transfusion to live, and I was the only person on Earth who could donate blood to save her, and even though donating blood is a relatively easy, safe, and quick procedure <strong>no one can force me to give blood. </strong>Yes, even to save the life of a fully grown person, it would be ILLEGAL to FORCE me to donate blood if I<em> didn’t want to.</em></p>
<p>See, we have this concept called “bodily autonomy.” It’s this….cultural notion that a person’s control over their own body is above all important and must not be infringed upon. </p>
<p>Like, we can’t even take LIFE SAVING organs from CORPSES unless the person whose corpse it is gave consent before their death. Even corpses get bodily autonomy. </p>

<p>To tell people that they MUST sacrifice their bodily autonomy for 9 months against their will in an incredibly expensive, invasive, difficult process to save what YOU view as another human life (a debatable claim in the early stages of pregnancy when the VAST majority of abortions are performed) is<strong> desperately unethical</strong>.<em> You can’t even ask people to sacrifice bodily autonomy to give up organs they aren’t using anymore after they have died. </em></p>
<p>You’re asking people who can become pregnant to accept less bodily autonomy than we grant to dead bodies. </p>

<p>Okay, I understand people being for abortion, but this argument doesn’t make sense as a response to that ad.</p>

<p>The whole point of the ad is that not only does not aborting a child save its life, but the fetus should not properly be considered as part of the mother’s body, because it is a different person.</p>

<p><i><b>The organs you aren’t allowed to take from dead people belong to the dead people - the fetus belongs to itself.</b></i></p>
<p>Fundamentally it comes down to: is it okay to kill a person if not killing the person would hurt you badly, both physically and financially?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another hole in that argument is that it equivocates between banning a medical therapy (abortion) , and compelling one (transfusion, organ transplant). While a lot of the consequences are the same, our legal system is <i>much</i> more willing to ban medical treatments, then compel them.  If you think those two are about the same in moral impact, then you don’t just have an argument for keeping abortion legal. You have an (possibly correct) argument for a radical overhall of the medical regulatory system, and for a regulatory system that is more libertarian on a range of attributes (for instance, I have a hard time seeing how the <a href="https://fee.org/articles/a-deadly-caution-how-fear-is-killing-patients/">precautionary principle</a> could survive that scrutiny). </p>
