<p>Now I’m not saying that anti Eastern European bigotry is a particularly pressing issue, and I’m aware this pales in comparison to the abuse Michelle Obama got and continues to get from people who disagree with her husband’s politics. </p>
<p>It’s just amazing to me how people who self identify as progressive think it’s absolutely justified and appropriate to be misogynist and xenophobic towards Melania Trump because her husband is misogynistic and xenophobic. </p>

<p>Those tweets are really disgusting. Assholes.<br /></p>

<p>“Leaving everything you know and marrying a foreigner you’ve never met out of economic desperation is hilarious and you should be punished for it.” Jesus, this is gross. <br /></p>
<p>(That said, anti-Eastern European bigotry <i>is</i> a pretty pressing issue worldwide. America is not the world, etc.) <br /></p>

<p>Yah. Those tweets are vile, and (particularly in Europe) xenophobia towards Eastern European immigrant is a big issue. </p><p>And the whole premise here is stupid, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump">Wikipedia says</a> that before marring Donald Melania was a fairly prominent model who was featured in a number of major publications and who won multiple awards and that Melania’s father was a politician and car dealership chain manager. So, I doubt she was poor. Oh, and she was living in New York City before she met Donald Trump, and they met at a fashion event there. </p>
