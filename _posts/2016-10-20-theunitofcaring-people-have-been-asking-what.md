<blockquote>
<p>People have been asking ‘what if it was the other way around?’ What if the dishonest, ignorant, underprepared, scary, demogoguish rapist candidate promised to appoint Supreme Court justices and advisors who shared your views, promised to pursue the policies you believed in, and the alternative was a capable, experienced, but deeply conservative politician? </p>
<p>And that’s a hard question, and I definitely struggled with it for a while.<br /></p>
<p>But I am not in doubt anymore. I will categorically never support for higher office a candidate who doesn’t believe in respecting the results of democratic elections. I will vote for a Pence, for a Cruz, for people who share no beliefs of mine at all except that this country transfers power by the ballot. </p>
