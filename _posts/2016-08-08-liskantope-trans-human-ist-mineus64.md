<h2>The Wage Gap And Working More <br /></h2>
<p>
A cartoon about the wage gap by me and Becky Hawkins, aka <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mUHxHDwbc_JU876DJeBETmA">@frenchtoastcomix</a><br /><br />If you like it, please share it!<br /><br />Read more cartoons! <a href="http://www.patreon.com/barry">www.patreon.com/barry</a><br />Here’s some info about how Becky and I split up the work, if you’re interested in “making of” stuff: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/6107370">https://www.patreon.com/posts/6107370</a><br /></p>

<p>Okay, what’s your point? Because I see you’re <i>trying</i> to make a point, but you really fell down at the first hurdle.<br /></p>

<p>It’s making the point that in hetero relationships, all of the house care, child care, and work that women (typically), put into the house, her husband, and their kids, isn’t seen as actual work or labor by men, and society in general, and is therefore not valued.. Like I watched this exact thing tear apart my parents marriage.. My Dad worked and my Mom didn’t, and my dad expected her to do everything around the house and took it completely for granted.. This is a pretty common problem for those that hold up traditional gender roles, and something that should be addressed along with the gender roles themselves.. Because this same issue can, and is, totally experienced by people of other genders than just female, and is something that should be called out.. like this comic is doing.. which is why I liked it</p>

<p>A little thing which I find particularly amusing in this cartoon is the way that the guy apparently types with one finger – very efficient “worker” there.<br /></p>

<p>Hunt and peck typer.</p><p>On a more serious note, it’s a good cartoon. </p><p>The “gap goes away after adjustment for a bunch of factors” argument is bunk for a number of reasons. </p><p>Another one (that is probably hard to put into cartoon form)  is that even direct discrimination can produce lower working hours. The adjustment procedure is assuming that discrimination and hours worked are independent variables. But that isn’t (necessarily) true.  Discrimination means that the demand curve for womens’ labor is shifted. This will result in lower quality (ie. hours worked) at equilibrium. </p><p>On the other hand, assuming that it’s all direct discrimination by employers (ie. employers discriminating against equally qualified female employees) is a dubious assumption.  It’s probably due to a wide range of cultural and economic factors.</p>
