<p>I wonder if David Friedman knows that he basically predicted Uber in 1973, except the (now) overly complicated system of identification cards and designated pickup stops that he envisioned was rendered unnecessary by the invention of the smartphone (which he had no reasonable reason to predict)?</p>
<p>See Chapter 16 (<a href="http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf">the bottom of page 41 here</a>) of Machinery of Freedom.</p>
<p>He even predicted (as literally any good libertarian could) that if anybody tried to create this system, the first thing government would do would be to to try to legislate it to protect taxi companies.<br /></p>

<p>I have a feeling that the limits of the idea in 1973 were transaction costs ie. the “overly complicated system of identification cards and designated pickup stops”, meaning that any such system would be undesirable compared to personally owned cars. The internet is good at eliminating those transaction costs.</p>
