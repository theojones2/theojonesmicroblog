<p>Tumblr’s tendency to promote political isolation (i.e., only associating with people who completely agree with your personal polemic) cannot feasibly carry over to most parts of your life. Like I want you all to know that part of being a successful adult with a job and networking and all that requires making connections with people you disagree with and not making a big deal about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I suspect that the only way anyone can do most SJ is by aggressively compartmentalizing.</p>
<p>Like I’m willing to bet at least middling sums of money that the same people who use aggressively separatist rhetoric on here are perfectly friendly to random men, random apparently straight people, random probably-cis folks.</p>
<p>But as soon as you get on Tumblr GOODBYE STRAIGHT PEOPLE OMG HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LOL MOST FUNNIEST JOKE THING</p>
<p>I honestly have begun to think these people find compartmentalizing so normal that they can’t even conceive that some people might not do it all the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe. Then again, I’ve known a lot of people who somehow manage to do the successful job-holding adult thing while verbally hating on everyone they disagree with.</p>
<p>The kinds of people who are hostile and entitled towards retail/service workers, for example - getting huffy and aggressive when things aren’t exactly to their liking, or loudly demanding that they not be served by the black cashier or the gay cashier. The leftist parallel to this would be things like harassing floor-level workers about appropriative Halloween costumes, which I’m pretty sure also happens. I can’t imagine any of these people being particularly diplomatic at their job.<br /></p>
<p>Then again, I’m willing to bet a lot of younger people, especially those with social anxiety and the like, don’t actually go around harassing people in person. Which I don’t blame them for, to be clear - I’m not calling them cowards or hypocrites for not doing that, because it feels taboo for a reason. But it probably does lead to feelings of built-up resentment that they can’t vent at these people they hate, which then comes out on Tumblr.</p>

<p>I think we might be talking about two different things?<br /><br />What I’m saying is… if you look at the people who ~ironic misandry~ all over the place, who ~poisoned m&amp;ms~ and ~male tears~… how do they act offline?<br /><br />Do they really have few male friends and acquaintances because being around men is triggering and women who mistrust men are reasonable in a dangerous world… or do they interact, in general, politely with their classmates, their coworkers, etc?<br /><br />It’s certainly possible some of them are real-world separatists, but I suspect a lot of them are not. I suspect a lot of them have men friends. I suspect a goodly number of them have at least one male family member they like.<br /><br />But ~male tears~, right? but ~don’t think of yourself as the exception, mr. privilege~<br /><br />It’s possible many of them actually are separatists, but I suspect a lot aren’t actually.<br /><br />And in that case, i think you have to compartmentalize to say these things.</p>

<p>My oldest niece is a separatist, although she picks and chooses her targets, as I suspect most separatists do.  My wife, who has been openly bisexual since before my niece was alive, was a target until my wife came out as a trans woman (and didn’t stop being a target right away after coming out).  My niece’s little brother, who told her he’s bisexual a few years ago, was not a target.  My niece says she hates men, but gay and by extension bi men are exceptions.  Because gay men are never misogynstic, in her mind, and when they are it’s to women she doesn’t like, so it’s whatever.
</p>
<p>
The only patterns I can consistently find are ableism, as well as “Don’t trust anyone over 30”, which is a tired mantra that is over 30 itself.  It’s 52, a year older than me.
</p>
<p>
Because she’s not someone with anxiety lashing out online because she can’t in real life.  She is supposedly neurotypical.  When she was little, I protected her from being caught by the psych system like I was, because I knew they’d be even worse to her than they were to me.  So she thinks she’s neurotypical.  I don’t know if she is.  She acts very rude in real life to people she thinks she’s justified to act rude to, usually from a cis feminist perspective, and is successful because she surrounds herself by fellow university people who admire her and elevate her.
</p>
<p>
I’m thinking about going into talk radio, because if she can get important politicians to listen to her by existing and being a university student, I certainly could do something but would feel better in a more serious and original platform than part of online social media.
</p>
<p>
So all that to say.  Separatists aren’t generally angry victims.  They’re generally fairly wealthy college and grad school kids who know exactly how to manipulate the system and will make up a large percentage of politicians in a few years, and this is nothing new.  They may or may not tone down their rhetoric then, but probably won’t unless they have wish for more mainstream control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely think some communities in college make it easy to be a separatist. I’m curious if she will continue to be after college or grad school, or if whatever job she gets will require her to be decent to wide swaths of other humans in order to obtain money.</p>
<p>Or is she planning to become a professor?</p>

<p>I know a few people like what rnilliken describes. When I have interacted with this type before, I’ve found their opinion to be that yes to some degree you kind of have to interact with other people with differing worldview. </p><p>But they find that to be a massive imposition. They think that ideally you shouldn’t tolerate the intolerant (or in many cases the “intolerant”) , and that ideally you should seek to cleanse your social circle to the extent possible and even your professional circle if you have enough power. </p><p>This is where stuff like the Yale costume controversy, and the XKCD cartoon argument on free speech, and the Eich incident come from. They find political isolation both their right and duty, even if they can only accomplish it in some cases. <br /></p>
