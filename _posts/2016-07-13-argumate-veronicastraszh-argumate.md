<p>I still think there is something to this. The point is, they are mapping their sexual preoccupations onto things they are not sexual. In other words, the issue is not that they slag dudes who are actually into the “cuck thing.” (Which, that’s bad enough, in the “let people have their kinks” sense.) But they go past that, to where this is the metaphor they choose for being pro-immigrant or pro-trans. The point is, they see society as being “cucked,” and therefore their political position is a personal rejection of cuck-ness.</p>
<p>The feminist critique practically writes itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>since much of the cuck discourse is an explicit critique of feminism, it seems more like the other way around. both sides are in agreement on most of the facts of the matter, they just disagree on the implications and moral valence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, just <i>no</i>. Feminists do not believe that women are male property, and thus a man cannot be lessened by non-exclusive sexual relationships, at least not when the arrangement is consual all around. Nor can his legitimate masculinity be challenged. What can instead be challenged is his childish, patriarchal need to own, to control, to dominate.</p>
<p>(Of course, there are many feminists. You can easily find some who believe that masculinity involves domination as an <i>essential</i> aspect. However, you can find feminists who do not. But more, I think if you look closely at the former group, you’ll find the extremes to be a small number, and you’ll find a lot of complexity along the spectrum.)</p>
<p>(I suspect you’d find broad agreement that this fixation with “cucking” is a symptom of <i>problematic</i> masculinity, which comes from the need to own and control. But that isn’t the same thing.)</p>
<p>(In case it is not obvious, I do not believe that masculinity is <i>essentially</i> anything at all. But whatever. The central tenet of my gender theory is we don’t understand gender.)</p>
<p>Anyway, feminists likewise do not accept a sexual metaphor for national politics. We critique (with various degrees of insight) the purity-shame response, and thus when the alt-right begins analyzing immigration through the lens of brown-men-white-women (which harkens back to the racist paranoia of the Jim Crow south), we immediately recognize what we are looking at. We reject it entirely.</p>
<p>So which facts do you think we agree on? That brown men are sexual predators invading the purity of white women? That men who support immigration are “cucks,” inasmuch as they should view brown-masculinity as a threat to white-femininity (and in turn the honor of their white male protectors), instead of seeing “brownness” as just another perfectly lovely shade of humanity?</p>
<p>Good grief. It’s all nonsense all the way down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you are missing the point. there is agreement that society is heading in a particular direction, and disagreement on whether that is a good thing or bad.</p>
<p>reactionary slurs imply it is a bad thing and those who think otherwise are fools, while progressive slurs imply it is a good thing and those who think otherwise are backwards facing troglodytes.</p>
<p>both sides accuse the other of being messed up about sex, of course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think both of you are over analyzing things here. “Cuck” and its variants effectively mean “sexually insufficient loser”. Its juvenile and immature and anyone who uses such insults in political discussions should be laughed at. But I don’t read much else into that. Probably the closest left wing phrase would be “neckbeard” and variants. </p><p>Here is how I interpret both    </p><blockquote><p><i>“You’re a cuck! You’re such a ugly loser your wife has probably cheated on you, and you get gratification from that. Loser!”<br /></i></p><p><i>“You’re a neckbeard! You’re such a ugly loser that you probably can’t get a date. You probably look like Jenkins from South Park!” </i><br /></p></blockquote>
