<p>I am Clinton voting and sympathetic to the goals of the left, but, I have developed a <em><strong>strong</strong></em> dislike for the left as currently exists. There is a really nasty political culture, particularly on the campus left. </p>
<p>There are people who can’t fathom the possibility that open discourse is important or that they could be wrong on a policy issue. So, they want to shut down all discourse and deal with others through intimation. Its gotten to the point that open discourse and free speech are becoming conservative values that the left on the whole is against, at least from my vantage point. These people don’t even attempt to understand why people believe what they believe, and think that anyone who is less left wing than them is debauched evil scum, or ill-informed.<br />
And worse of all, they can’t realize that even when the values of it are put aside, this type of strategy is self-destructive because the changes they are making to the social norms that govern political discourse will be used against them eventually. They think that they can limit harassment and vilification and no-platforming and personal destruction of their political opponents to just their enemies.<br />
And as Bernie’s campaign shows this toxic culture is escaping the left-wing enclaves that are its home and leaking very quickly into the political mainstream.</p>
