<p>not to be an Sjw™ but uh…. trigger jokes are essentially jokes about actual ptsd and the real, terrifying, and often humiliating symptoms that come with it. maybe it’s because im not hip w/ the kids, but i don’t really understand the humor in making fun of literal trauma. idk just stay away from me with all that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing is, though, it’s not making jokes about trauma itself, it’s making jokes about people appropriating the language and experience of trauma to be assholes about their beliefs on the Internet and to have a built-in wall to hide behind when attacked. It’s about people who straight-up <i>lie</i> about having a mental condition to look “cool”, and change their supposed trigger every two weeks so that people have to bend to their whims all the damn time. Basically, the jokes are about passive-aggressive abusers who invoke the language of PTSD and trauma to get people to kiss their asses and to boss others around needlessly.</p>

<p>I also really hope the people saying this sort of thing are actually people who have PTSD<br /><br />Not because I want to be one of those gatekeepery “you must be THIS mentally ill to ride this ride” bozos<br /><br />but rather because I really don’t like the idea of someone who doesn’t grok what I’ve experienced deciding whether I can or can’t think it’s sometimes funny, and/or that the way people have taken it and ran with it is sometimes funny<br /><br />if there is a god she gave me a right to my salt <br /><br />i’ve earned it</p>

<p>Although I do think that the people without actual disabilities, as @bizarrolord put it, “appropriating the language and experience of trauma to be assholes about their beliefs on the Internet”  have done a lot of damage to actual disability accommodation by turning a fairly common symptom into the butt of a joke, and by making it so that people will be suspicious that proposals to improve the accommodation of those symptoms are actually made in bad faith to gain political points.</p>
