<blockquote>
<p>It’s interesting how jailing political opponents is associated with dictatorship, and maintaining stable democracy requires occasionally turning a blind eye even to actual transgressions of the law.</p>
<p>When you give people ultimate power it helps to reassure them that they won’t be prosecuted for giving it up, as corrupt as that sounds.</p>
