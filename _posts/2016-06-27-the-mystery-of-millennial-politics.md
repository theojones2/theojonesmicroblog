<p>Here’s the deal. Millennials are more liberal on general ideology 
measures. But their liberalism is specifically concentrated in a 
particular set of issues: Homosexuals (e.g., items on same-sex marriage and whether homosexuality should be accepted or discouraged), Middle East (i.e., opinions about use of military force and various conflicts in Middle East), Immigration, Marijuana legalization, Environmental regulation (e.g., whether stricter environmental laws are worth the cost), and general attitudes towards the Federal government (e.g., whether they trust the government and think the government generally does a good job).</p>
<p>But their liberalism on these issue items ends there. Millennials are
 only marginally or no more liberal than older folks when it comes to Big business (e.g., whether corporations make too much profit or whether the economic system unfairly favors powerful interests), Support for the poor (e.g., whether government aid to the poor is a good idea), Racial issues (e.g., whether the U.S. needs to continue making changes to give blacks equal rights), Gun regulation, and Abortion rights.</p>
<p>
All the obvious theories fall apart. Has Obama led them to be 
pervasively liberal? No. Are they pervasively “social” or “cultural” 
liberals? No. Are they anti-discrimination liberals? Yes on gays and 
immigrants; no on blacks. Are they secular lifestyle liberals? Yes on 
gays and pot; no on abortion. Have their experiences in the Great 
Recession led to an unusually leftward tilt on rich-poor issues? Really 
no. Is their liberalism a statistical side-effect of the fact that they 
contain higher proportions of minority, immigrant, non-religious, or 
economically struggling folks? That’s part of it (i.e., the blue bars in
 the chart are generally shorter than the green bars) but clearly not 
the whole story. <br /></p>

<p>I’d been waiting to see someone separate out ideological shifts from the changing demographics of Millenials.<br /></p>

<p>Individualist your-right-to-swing-your-fist-ends-where-my-nose-begins tendencies seem like they could explain everything here.</p>
<p>- Gonna ignore self-labeled ideology and Pew Ideology Scale to focus on specific issues.</p>
<p>- Federal government: more of an issue for ancaps or tea partiers rather than social libertarians.</p>
<p>- Big business opposition goes away after confounds are removed.. The belief that people ought to be able to form contracts so long as they don’t directly affect anyone else fits the hypothesis.</p>
<p>- Support for the poor is generally opposed to non-aggression-principle libertarianism, so it makes sense that we wouldn’t be especially liberal here either.</p>
<p>- Differences on racial issues go away after controlling for confounds. Libertarians aren’t normally big on racial justice (or social obligation to others or oppression based morality more broadly) except when it lets them complain about cops. Every-man-for-himself morality makes sense here.</p>
<p>- Support for immigration (i.e. the belief that people should be able to move wherever they want without the government interfering) is another social libertarian position. Note in particular how this contrasts with beliefs about racial issues as seen above, indicating that a general pro- or anti-minority stance doesn’t work here.</p>
<p>- Opposing interventionism is also a libertarian thing.</p>
<p>- Gun regulation is also associated with libertarian politics and support for personal freedoms.</p>
<p>- Environmental regulation is basically just regulating externalities, a.k.a. direct harms to other people’s bodies and property. Maybe I’m reaching too far here, but it makes sense in my head.</p>
<p>- Gay rights = more social freedom. Not much else to say here.</p>
<p>- Abortion is hugely controversial because no one can decide whether it counts as an exercise of bodily autonomy or an act of harm toward another human being, so it’s not surprising that there’s no consensus here.</p>
<p>- People want to be able to 420 blaze it every day without other people interfering, which also fits.</p>
<p>The real test would be to see whether you could predict what side of various issues people would fall in with a personal autonomy ethos in mind. I kinda wanna run this experiment now.</p>

<p>I’m not sure you are doing this, but I think it is a bit off to say that millennials as a whole are more libertarian. I think there are two dynamics here 1) to the extent that there are conservative/center-right Millenials they are libertarian-ish conservatives. I know a lot of people who came from conservative families but became libertarians. And (although I am not a member of them) the conservative/GOP clubs on my campus have a very libertarian bent to their membership from my interactions with them. 2) I think millennials tend to have more extreme views than the general population (although perhaps not more left-wing ones) ie. take the world of campus activism and social justice activism. Some of the left-wing form of this is quite non-libertarian and has an authoritarian bent (ie. the left’s retreat from civil liberties and freedom of speech)</p></div>
