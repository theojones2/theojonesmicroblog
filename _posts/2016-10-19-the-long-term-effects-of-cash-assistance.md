<p>We are able to identify
[the long-term effects of cash assistance] by following up, after four decades, with participants in the Seattle-Denver Income
Maintenance Experiment (SIME/DIME), which began in 1970. This experiment, described in more
detail in Section 2, guaranteed a minimum annual income of up to $25,9008
to about half of the
4,800 low- to middle-income families enrolled. Treated families, randomly chosen from among all
enrolled families, received the full guaranteed income if they earned no outside income; they then
faced taxes of 50% to 80% on outside income, up to the point where the program no longer benefited
them. Treated families received this financial guarantee for three or five years, and treatment
enabled an individual to receive, on average, $2,400 extra annually in government benefits during the experiment, compared to control individuals who did not receive any SIME/DIME guarantee.<br /></p>
<p>SIME/DIME and previous smaller Income Maintenance Experiments (IMEs) were originally
proposed to determine how a negative income tax (NIT) would affect labor supply and other outcomes. […] As discussed
by Robins and West (1983), treatment caused adults to work about 10 to 20 percent fewer hours
during the experiment. They also earned about $1,800 less per year. However, treated adults observed
in the two years after the experiment ended did not work significantly different hours than
control adults, or earn significantly different incomes.<br /></p>
<p>Although short-term effects have been previously analyzed, no outcomes were measured after
the 1970s. Since the IMEs were the first large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the social
sciences, they offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the long-term effects of a large intervention on
participants. Adults from SIME/DIME have now had four decades for effects from the experiment
to accumulate or taper off, so any long-term effects are likely to have already occurred. […]<br /></p>
<p>We are able to determine long-term outcomes by combining SIME/DIME data with administrative
records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Washington State Department
of Health (WA DOH). Our main outcome measures come from SSA data, which includes annual
earned income between 1978 and 2013; information on applications for, and awards of, disability benefits; and mortality. […]<br /></p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Using this matched data set, we find new evidence of significant effects on adults decades after
the experiment ended. On average, treatment decreased the probability that participants work
in a given year by 3.3 percentage points (4.6% of the mean probability of working for adults in
our sample), and decreased average annual earnings by $1,800 (7.4% of mean annual earnings).
Treated adults were also 6.3 percentage points (20% of the mean) more likely to apply for disability
benefits (either SSDI or SSI), but were not significantly more likely to be awarded benefits, or to
have died. These effects for adults, described in more detail in Section 4, are large relative to the
cash assistance received: for every $1 in additional government transfers, we find that individuals
earn discounted lifetime earnings that are $4.50 lower. The effects are mainly evident later in
individuals’ lives: for example, effects on annual earnings are $2,000 stronger between ages 50 and
60 than before that age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>income guarantees discourage work, encourage early retirement, encourage disability claims, and displace more earned income than the benefit itself provides</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This “confirms my priors” as well, but what’s supposed to be the mechanism for strong effects later in life from a program only a few years long?</p>
<p>That part I’m more dubious of.</p>

<p>The one thing I noted is the large benefit amount of $25k, compared to the poverty line of about $13k </p></div>
