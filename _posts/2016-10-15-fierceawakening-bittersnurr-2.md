<p>I really hate generation wars, but tbh sometimes I wonder if the folks who parrot “I am not a government” whenever anyone says free speech is important are kids who have never had something they love threatened as obscene or a bad influence or a corrupter of youth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there a generation where kids didn’t have what they love threatened as obscene or a bad influence or a corrupter of youth? Because I am 99% sure I saw an ad spot for the local evening news about how Pokemon Go is creating thieving child gangs. </p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>I haven’t really seen anything like we saw in the age of Tipper Gore, though. I mean yes, that resulted in content labeling rather than censorship, but – I had little idea until I got a lot older that gangsta rap wasn’t just violent and smutty, but also political.</p>
<p>Nowadays it’s often the young folks themselves who are the content policers, on a truly bizarre theory that seems to go like “if you see stories about this bad thing, you will like it; if you never see those stories, you will know abuse and pedophilia are bad.”</p>

<p>Yeah i am guessing part of it is any actual examples I can think of all have a Tumblr Approved Oppression Axis involved that probably gets any of it just lumped in with general bigotry because most of it also isn’t <i>enforced</i>?</p>
<p>Like I very distinctly remember for example the ORIGINAL backlash to pokemon and how people were talking about it leading to satanism or some shit. OR stuff with video games being accused of causing mass shootings. <br /></p>
<p>But most of it was basically a joke. Not a joke as in intended to be a joke but something the majority of people recognized as stupid.</p>
<p>But at the same time like the video game thing I’ve seen RECENTLY BEEN SAID BY FEMINISTS. Like apparently anita for example is totally behind “violent video games all need to be banned” and for some reason some supposedly progressive people are falling for that now. The same exact argument conservatives were making back when I was in school when shootings were a new scary thing. But if it’s framed as fighting back against sexist gamers people are ok with it somehow I don’t understand.</p>
<p>IDK maybe I am old. Like a lot of the people into this shit seem to be maybe 5 years younger then me at least. Do those people remember this stuff from the early 2000′s when people were still claiming rap music and the matrix caused this shit? Probably not.</p>
<p>Me on the other hand? When I was 14 I <i>intentionally invoked  </i>that shit for the purpose of safety. You would be surprised how fast people stopped bullying me when I started wearing a trenchcoat to school because of the symbolism of what it meant. But nowadays? I wouldn’t be surprised if people got suspended over that wardrobe choice…<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this.</p>
<p>I really hope Anita didn’t say that. I think some of what she says gets distorted because she’s a convenient villain.</p>
<p>But I also wouldn’t be surprised if she DID say it, and as someone who remembers the craziness over DOOM and related games, the idea of going through that shit again FROM THE LEFT THIS TIME kind of makes me want to facepalm hard enough and repeatedly enough to put myself into a nice soothing coma.</p>

<p>I don’t really think the “I am not a government” line comes from people who have never faced the risk of censorship. I think it more comes from a strange (at least from my perspective) conception of what type of right free speech is. </p><p>The people who use the “not a government” line seem to think the whole idea of a non-governmental actor ever engaging in censorship is incoherent in a way that they don’t with other rights (imagine how these people would respond to someone making the “not a government” line ). It’s just a non-sequitur to them. Their response to that idea is about what I would respond to someone started talking about how some action not related to the government violated separation of powers.  Now, there are some reasons to them why actions that cause someone to be silenced might be <i>bad</i> , but you can’t call it <i>censorship</i>.  </p><p>And this doesn’t really seem to be dependent on if they like the speaker or not. A while ago (I could dig up the link on request) there was an article about Brian Krebs on a major tech site (I remember it being ArsTechnica which has a left-leaning audience). Krebs is a journalist who writes about computer crime. Turns out the criminals didn’t like getting written about, and Krebs’ writing was forced off the internet due to a monster DDOS and a harassment campaign. The article contained a quote calling it a danger to free speech on the internet, and a case of censorship. Strangely, In the comments, there were a bunch of people (as far as I can tell sincerely) complaining about the article calling it censorship. Because the actions may of been bad, but unless it was the government it has nothing to do with censorship. </p><p>Here is my hypothesis on this. There are really two types of rights 1) rights that come out of externally justified social goals &ndash; think of, let&rsquo;s say, anti-discrimination it&rsquo;s fundamentally bad if there is pervasive discrimination against minority groups, and 2) procedural constraints on the government. </p><p>I think most of the “I’m not a government” types fundamentally see free speech as, not a worthy goal in its own, but at best a procedural constraint on governments. <br /></p><p>When one of their works, or an author they like gets targeted, they will usually appeal to some <i>other</i> value. Because free speech to them (even when they feel it is applicable) is a very weak value to appeal to. As a different one liner from that type puts it, “when you talk about free speech all that means is you have no better defence than itsa not literally illegal to say that”.  When a bit of rap music they are fine with gets censored, they will talk about racism. When a GamerGate type sends death threats to shut up a blogger he doesn’t like they will talk about sexism or harassment. </p>
