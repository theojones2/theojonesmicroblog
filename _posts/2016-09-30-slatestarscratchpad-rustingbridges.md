<p><a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/28/ssc-endorses-clinton-johnson-or-stein/">The latest SSC post</a> is fucking awful in so many ways. I could easily see it written by someone like David Frum. </p>
<p>It’s… naive conservative elitism. Complete, of course, with “poor rural white people are scum of the earth and their culture makes them unfit for democracy”. Which is only bad when the likes of The Daily Show liberals do it, apparently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many ways I think it’s worse than that, taken on its own *substantive* merits, but consider who the explicit target audience is: SSC readers who are likely to vote for Trump. So, highly educated whites, worldview strongly based in HBD (including using that name, the American Nations stuff, probably not antisemitic, etc,) skeptical of political democracy but not enough to go join the quietism of the more thoroughgoing formalists. If it didn’t go out of its way to Darkly Hint or just up and say things like “whites in Appalachia are a degenerate strain lost to the race” etc AND also hating on the Daily Show etc (which, as you say, basically believes the same thing, albeit without any principled regard for how it fits into the rest of their worldview) it would lack credibility.</p>

<p>@multiheaded1793, I don’t really know what you want from me here.</p>
<p>I mean, you just escaped Russia where it seems like most citizens want to put people in jail (or worse) for being openly transgender. Do you agree this is really bad, and that something is wrong in a fundamental way, beyond the point where just asking them nicely to change their opinion and maybe giving them a good book on the subject is going to do any good?</p>
<p>I’m not saying anybody is “scum of the earth”. I’m saying that when a majority of people want to do things like jail transgender people, it’s hard to say “Well, I guess the will of the people has spoken, the system works”. Activism is sort of useful (when you’re in a country that permits it and where there are enough people who disagree that you can credibly get a legislative/judicial majority) but the other side gets to do activism too, so all that ends up doing is favoring whichever side can be most effectively compressed into a sound-bite.</p>
<p>I would like to be elitist, but unfortunately it’s not that easy because elites are only slightly less hopeless than plebians. I can’t even be cryptomonarchist, because I expect monarchs wouldn’t be any less hopeless than plebians and elites. </p>
<p>I don’t think it’s contradictory to say both &quot;Appalachian farmers have some pretty awful opinions and it’s scary to be in a country where a large enough number of them can enshrine those opinions as policy&quot; and “Daily Show-watching liberals have some pretty awful opinions and it’s scary to be in a country where a large enough number of them can enshrine those opinions as policy”. In fact, I think that’s the <i>least</i> contradictory position I could hold.</p>
<p>I think there are probably incremental things we can do to align incentives better, but I’m not sure how to talk about them without mentioning that a lot of people have some pretty creepy beliefs and don’t seem willing to give them up, and that’s a problem that either needs to be passively accepted or else somehow routed around.</p>
<p>This isn’t HBD - I don’t care if Appalachian farmers ended up 75%+ pro-Trump because of genes, environment, culture, discrimination, or what. The point is, I’m in a democracy where about 33% of the population has values that seem repugnant to me, and that makes life pretty complicated, and I’m not sure how you want me to avoid thinking about that.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to speak for Esther, but I’m p sure she didn’t say anything about wanting you to avoid thinking on this or any other subject? If I say I don’t like a chair that’s a distinct claim from saying no one should ever take up carpentry, or even that the particular act of engaging in carpentry that produced it was wrong, just that the thing it resulted in was dissatisfactory this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then maybe I’m confused. How do I bring this up without saying that Southern rural etc Trump supporters seem to have some opinions I consider pretty awful? And if that’s not what Multi’s upset about, what is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can’t speak for the rest of this chain, but I find your usage of borderer disagreeable. They may or may not be borderers (I haven’t read the book and also haven’t found clear statistics), and they may or may not be irredeemably terrible, but you’ve assumed that, and a half-hearted entry into race realism isn’t doing you any political favors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So would your complaint disappear if I said “Southerners” or “people in the Appalachians” or “poor religious white people”?<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes (at least for me, I can’t speak for rusting). While I agree with a lot of the rest of your posts in this thread, and the SSC post, that usage was cringey. </p>
