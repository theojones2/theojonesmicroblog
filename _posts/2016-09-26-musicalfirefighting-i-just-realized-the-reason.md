<blockquote>
<p>I just realized the reason I feel so much from scott’s untitled isn’t that I have at all the same sort of problem scott aa had. I don’t have low self-esteem, I haven’t actually been meaningfully hurt by feminism, I certainly don’t think my problems come from the way attraction to women is perceived. It’s also not that the thesis “scott aa was not actually very entitled” is viscerally powerful to me.</p>
<p>Rather, it’s that I feel the same paradox:<br />1. I am not owed anybody’s care, or anybody’s friendship.<br />2. I’m doing a lot of things you’re supposed to do: starting conversations, joining social activities, listening and being supportive.<br />3. I still have no friends.</p>
<p>And add in the fact that even at my level of assertiveness, some of the things I’ve done have made others uncomfortable, and it becomes very difficult to see any path where I both get friends and respect everyone’s boundaries.</p>
<p>I don’t think I have that high a chance of picking the first rather than the second, but it’s a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>(”you don’t have an obligation to not make people uncomfortable” =&gt; “I don’t get as much positive out of the experience as other people lose out of it” + “everything is permissible, but not everything is beneficial”)</p>

<p>Yah.  I pretty much have the same issue/feelings here. Particularly the three part paradox.</p>
