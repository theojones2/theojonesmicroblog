<p>Nothing is going to change. Americans love their guns more than they love people and after Sandy Hook we decided that killing over 20 children was acceptable and not outrageous enough to make reasonable restrictions on guns. This is America, a country that has been around for 200 years, a superpower, a 1st world nation, and one of the wealthiest countries on the planet and we refuse to protect our own people. We respect guns more than we respect the lives of people. </p>

<p>What specific gun control measures would you propose and how would they directly and effectively make society safer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Absolutely get rid of all AR-15′s and the like.<br /></li>
<li>Intense background and criminal background checks and anything violent automatically disqualifies you.<br /></li>
<li>Make getting a gun/gun permit more like getting a driver’s license:<br /></li>
<ul><li>permit to learn</li>
<li>includes an exam with 18 or more questions on the policies, laws, and etc of guns and gun ownership</li>
<li>if you get more than 8 questions incorrect you must retake it.</li>
</ul><li>30 hours of practical experience at a gun range with a licensed teacher<br /></li>
<li>Must take a 5 hour class on the dangers of guns and how to use them safely which will then yield you a certificate that grants you to take the practical exam and lasts for one year. If you don’t gain the license within the allotted year you must retake the class.<br /></li>
<li>A practical exam with a licensed instructor who will grade you on various skills. If you pass you may be granted a permit on the weapon of your choice, the exams may differ on the type of firearm you want.<br /></li>
<li>Follow the Japanese model where you must have two gun safes in different areas of the house, one to store the gun and one to store the bullets and you must provide the police with information on where those safes are.<br /></li>
<li>No concealed carry and only handguns may be allowed to be out in public.<br /></li>
<li>If transporting a weapon, it must be in the trunk of the vehicle, in a bag or some other case, safety on and unloaded and may not leave the vehicle until you are at the destination.<br /></li>
<li>If you’re a hunter or some other gun hobbyist that requires a functional weapon other than a handgun then the gun must stay on the premises, whether that is a gun range or the Fish and Wildlife facility.<br /></li>
<li>If you live in a rural area where police (and people, for that matter) are few and far between, something akin to a deer hunting rifle should provide plenty of protection from predators and poachers, you still have to follow the aforementioned steps.<br /></li>
<li>This doesn’t cover everything but I think it’s a good place to start.<br /></li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Can you show me evidence that this would directly and effectively create a safer society?</p>

<p>I have never laughed so hard at a gun law post. Like seriously, the evidence is in fucking reality. The proposed restrictions are just fucking logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If twenty white children getting killed at school didn’t change our laws nothing will. They don’t give a damn and it won’t change. We have this conversation every time there’s a massacre.</p>

<p>My one problem with this post is that Australia isn’t “totally super safe!!” as it claims to be since there’s still a pretty high homicide rate despite having gun control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, I’ll say it. </p>
<p>Those three countries, first of all, are pretty darn homogenous, so to speak. Australia and Switzerland are significantly tinier than the USA in population as well. Well Japan too, if still rather bigger than the previous two examples. Japan is um, rather right-wing. Switzerland is asshole-isolationist and its politics wouldn’t please most people on this site if they bothered to look into it. </p>
<p>(I could say still more on that stuff but it would be really unpleasant for everyone involved.) </p>
<p>Even if you repeal the 2nd amendment then given the, ah, unique circumstances the USA has, well, I don’t think it’s really going to solve the problem. If anything it might highlight certain unspeakable aspects even more…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To paraphrase a good friend: gun violence in America is massively a problem of white southerners and black people, which are two highly violent cultures. Gun control measures on the state level show no statistical impact unless you remove those two from the equation, which poses an interesting question.</p>
<p>Also, when it comes to random mass shootings per capita, Switzerland is actually ahead of the US*. Lol.**</p>
<p>*ignoring school shootings and hate crime for data reliability reasons<br />** friendly reminder that the perpetrator in this case was a security guard and thus one of the few classes of people who could get an open carry permit even in Germany, so your gun control would have done fuck all (and he passed all the checks)</p>
