<p>Some brief thoughts on the male birth control study controversy.</p>
<p>A male birth control study <a href="http://www.snopes.com/male-birth-control-study/">got shut down</a> part of the way through because an outside medical board raised concerns over the fact that the male trial participants experienced negative side effects similar to those women regularly face on birth control, leading 20 of the male participants to quit. In reaction, many women have been rightly pointing out that 1.) those sorts of safety protections were totally non-existent during trials for female birth control, 2.) that its negative side effects have still gone largely ignored by the medical community despite being widely reported by women for half a century, and 3.) that expressions of pain and discomfort like the one that the men in that study expressed are often explained away or totally ignored by the medical profession when they’re expressed by women.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some other publications like <i>Cosmopolitan</i> have reacted by <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a8038748/male-birth-control-study-stopped/">saying</a> “Welcome to the club, dudes. Also: WOMAN UP”; <i>Salon</i> posted <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a8038748/male-birth-control-study-stopped/">their article</a> with a picture of a baby crying; and USA Today wrote in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/01/male-birth-control-study-nixed-after-men-cant-handle-side-effects-women-face-daily/93088124/">their headline</a> that the trial was cancelled because “men can’t handle side effects women face every day” (even though 82.3% of men remaining in the study at the final check-up <a href="//press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jc.2016-2141">said</a> they’d be willing to use a similar product, see table 3).</p>
<p>I find this reaction really puzzling, because the implied message seems not to be that “we should be treating women’s medical issues just as seriously as the men’s issues were in this study” but “if men were really as tough as they thought they were, they’d welcome being treated with the same medical neglect women currently are.” Which… would be a step backwards. The problem wasn’t that the men should have sucked it up dealt with the side effects, the problem is that <i>women shouldn’t have to</i>. Those publications are disparaging men for <i>not accepting</i> the very side effects that we <i>want</i> <i>to be made unacceptable</i> for women, all the while attacking men for deviating from the masculine norm of performative toughness. That seems to be the exact opposite message that should be taken out of this.</p>

<p>I think you’re mostly right <i>except,</i> there is the potential argument that the birth control pill is a miraculous invention that has significantly improved people’s lives, and thus, if the side-effects are minor enough that women have been mostly toughing it out for 50 years without complaint, it’s acceptable to ask men to just tough it out too. <br /></p>

<p>Right.  I’m mostly sympathetic to critiquing SJ for the failure mode of hurting privileged groups rather than helping oppressed ones, but this time they kind of have a point.  Mostly because this is zero sum: one party in the relationship is going to be on birth control.</p>
<p>The fear from the feminists’ side is that we develop this thing and men use their social power to make sure they’re never the ones that have to bear the side effects (I mean, we’ve already got condoms which produce no mood swings and hormonal BC is preferred because it makes sex better mostly for the man).</p>
<p>This seems to me both likely, and excuses a lot of the anger and frankly rancor this is producing.  I’d be pissed too.</p>
<p>(All of this contingent on the similarity of side effects  between the two camps, which I’ve seen called into question on tumblr)</p>

<p>What do we know about popular press coverage of scientific issues?</p><p>Thats right, its garbage and you should trust actual expert sources instead of blogs and magazine articles . </p><p>What do we know about that coverage when it is adjacent to controversial political issues? </p><p>Its even worse than usual. </p><p>Snopes actually is an exception to that rule and does a good job flagging the issues here: </p><p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/male-birth-control-study/">http://www.snopes.com/male-birth-control-study/</a><br /></p><p>1) Regulators and IRBs treat drugs invented before 1961 much differently than modern drugs (due to the regulatory changes made throughout the world after the Thalidomide scandal). If female hormonal contraception (mostly invented before 1961) had to be evaluated under the rules for modern drugs then they would run into pretty major issues for having excessive side effects. </p><p>2) The WHO (which was overseeing the study) decided to pull the plug on it due to those issues. </p><p>3) Research on the drug is ongoing and the drug may get further clinical trials after adjustments. </p><p>Also, notice the overlap between the people writing the “WOMAN UP” shitposts and the people who support the over-broad regulatory rules that created the issue.</p>
