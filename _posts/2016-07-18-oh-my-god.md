<p>&gt; I’m a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:   [/r/badphilosophy] In which eating vegan is deontological and only crypto-religious SJeWs think destroying species is automatically bad</p>
<p>Ugh. Look, we’ve all thought about doing illegal stuff relating to genetic engineering, and the fact that we do so out loud on public fora implies, IMO, that we’re not that likely to do it. Calm down. (Also, biodiversity is not an intuitively obvious terminal value.)</p>

<p>The r/SSC discussion is in pure scifi territory, as current tech isn’t to the point where someone in a basement with out the backing of a major company or a state, could do a project that complex (and the tech to eradicate mosquito-borne diseases with modified mosquitos is at least a few years away). </p><p>But in re the r/badphilosophy thread, I’m amazed that there people who actually think that a technology that would save a million lives a year should be banned. If such tech did exist, then <i>of course, </i>it should be deployed<i>. </i>The benefits are so vast here and the diseases so destructive, that there isn’t really a substantial tradeoff here. And yes, if the level of tech assumed in the SSC thread did appear in real life, then civil disobedience would be perfectly moral in my opinion.</p><p>To be somewhat harsh and uncharitable here, considering that much more stingy environmental tradeoffs are made in favor of human health and well-being all the time, the reason that this discussion occurs in response to malaria prevention has more than a little to do with the fact that the people who get malaria are 1) foreigners, and 2) not white. </p>
