<p>of course if fag and now cuck are reactionary slurs against those who are perceived not to follow traditional masculine roles, you might wonder what are the progressive slurs against those who do.</p>
<p>and one answer is dudebro, because what could be more insulting than to emphasise that someone is a <i>man</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Errr, doesn’t “dudebro” refer to a <i>specific</i> hypermasculine subculture where men tend to go “dude!” and “bro!”? So dudebro isn’t really a reference to someone’s maleness as much as to their participation in said subculture?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>right. but hypermasculine dudebro literally means “very manly man-man”, I mean when used as an insult that’s sort of telling, don’t you think?</p>
<p>(some might say toxic masculinity, eg. so manly you’ve literally overdosed on testosterone, and others might say fragile masculinity, eg. so manly you defend your ego by lashing out in violent ways).</p>
<p>when a worldview treats the very essence of an entire gender as being a slur, there is going to be some level of resistance, I would think. and the cuck epithet neatly targets men who go along with this usage.</p>
