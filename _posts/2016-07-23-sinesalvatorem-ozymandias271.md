<p>I’ve… Never really thought about how retarded this is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Retarded is barely scratching the surface. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Want to know what real fucking retarded is?<br /><br />Years ago, I got taken to court because this girl I slept with got pregnant, and she didn’t know if it was mine, her bf’s, or the black guy she was screwing as well.<br /><br />So I get put through the test procedures, swabbing and such; lo and behold, it ain’t my kid. It was the black fella<br /><br />But her parents (being upper-class) didn’t like the fact that their grandchild was fathered by an unemployed person (both the black guy and her bf were on unemployment), while I was working as a chef. So, they told their lawyer to motion the court to assign child support payments to me, and he did. <br /><br />And I thought the judge, after hearing such bullshit, would immediately chuck the case out. But I was wrong. She told me seeing as I was already probably preparing myself to be a parent, I should just shoulder the burden and accept it. “From what I can see, you’d be the best choice as father” I was told.<br /><br />I had to literally deny all out paying anything and threaten to go to the media just to get a new judge. And what happened when the new judge saw the summary, and heard the lawyer say “It’s pretty simple your honor. Mr Scarecrow is the best chance this child has for a father, and should pay child support”?<br /><br />“Are you mentally challenged?” she asked the lawyer.<br /><br />It was thrown out and the family was fined for making me miss work.</p>

<p>Jesus fucking wept, this is our legal system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, technically that’s Australia’s legal system. But that very well could happen in the US (and probably has). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consent to sex doesn’t even matter in some cases.</p>
<p>Rape victims have been ordered to pay their rapists.</p>
<p>Specifically statutory rape victims who were minors at the time they were victimized.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/</a><br /><br />There are cases where it even goes to trial and the individual is named the victim of the sexual assault… <b><i>and their rapist is still awarded child support.</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>in france (if I’m not mistaken ) DNA paternity tests don’t even matter, if a woman tells the court that she doesn’t want one had hen any form of it is thrown out the window and he gets fisted by the legal system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah man<br />In france, DNA tests are illegal evidence.<br />They can sue you 600,000 € for presenting it.<br />It happened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the fuck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is… wow.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Axiom 1:</b> If you want children to be taken care of, pay for it from taxes. If you don’t want to pay for it from your taxes, other people’s children are obviously not worth being supported against your will. Thus, why the fuck are you trying to force others to something you would’t be willing to face yourself. On the other hand if you are willing to support children from taxes, we don’t need a separate construct of child support complicating things.</p>
<p><b>Axiom 2:</b> Do you want me to show the utility calculations of being forced to pay child support? Because there’s a reasonably good argument that being forced to pay child support is definitely in the same category of burdensomeness as an unwanted pregnancy and if being forced to take an unwanted pregnancy to term as a possible consequence of having sex is unfair, so is non-consensual child support. And the answer is, yes, those both are extremely unfair consequences.</p>
<p>This is why I seriously lobby for paper abortions ~everywhere because it should be bloody obvious that one’s gender, or anatomy, or whatever the fuck, shouldn’t determine the harshness of consequences having sex exposes them to. We already settled a long time ago that such a thing is called “sexism” and it is bad and should be abolished.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Axiom 1 makes no sense. It’s like saying that because I think people should have to pay their debts if possible, I have a responsibility to do it myself and should be taxed to that end.</p>
<p>And if it’s so unfair to expect parents to shoulder the financial burden of their children, how is it more fair to demand the same of uninvolved bystanders?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should you be forced to pay the debt of someone else, when you never consented to the debt in the first place? That’s my entire point; the child support laws which don’t give people input to whether they consent to child support and instead just assume it from the fact that sex happened (or in the more horrifying cases, from being raped or from some contrived chain of events) are about as fair as you being held responsible for the debts someone else racked up just because you lent them a fiver when they were in need. Yes, ~*~technically~*~ you could argue that by giving them a fiver you demonstrated consent to paying for their shit (and arbitrarily huge amounts of it even), but that explanation won’t hold in any reasonable place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d like to see those utility calculations, please. <br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My source says that the average child support payment is around $5k a year. Over 18 years this totals $90k. If we discount future payments and say it’s roughly equivalent to $50k immediately stuff gets a bit easier to estimate because I’m lazy.</p>
<p>Thus, if I assume that child support and pregnancy are roughly equivalent in burdensomeness it implies that pregnancy could be compared to a job which should pay $50k. The market price for surrogate mothers seems to be somewhere around half that, thus implying that the people who are likely to become surrogates (for whom the disutility of pregnancy is surely lower than average) value not having a pregnancy less than half of the estimated value of total child support.</p>
<p>An obvious objection to this is that those people are outliers and the typical person who would choose abortion instead of carrying the pregnancy to term and giving the baby for adoption would value not being pregnant much more. That is a fair objection. The same obvious objection can be made that the people who would sign off their child support payments would be likely to assign extra value to not paying child support. I consider that objection a fair one too.</p>
<p>Thus, a simple ballpark estimate suggests that the burden of paying child support is definitely comparable to the burden of a pregnancy at least within one order of magnitude; and that since it is obviously unjust that a person might be forced to endure a pregnancy simply for having had sex, it is not obviously just that a person might be forced to endure child support simply for having had sex.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this risk of child support is very unevenly distributed and since it is reasonable that we should try to avoid having situations where people get excessively serious but rare consequences this cannot be readily compared to how much “child support insurance” would cost per sex act (a number I am unable to provide; I suspect that if people who produce fertile semen had to pay the child support insurance they might be okay with it, but the random and uncontrollable nature of actually happening makes it extra burdensome).</p>
<p>In light of this I consider it totally reasonable that people should be able to have a “paper abortion” where they would lose all the rights of parenthood if the pregnancy is carried to term, along with all the obligations, in exchange for providing an amount of money that would be sufficient to pay for an abortion and its associated costs which the pregnant person may spend as they wish, and informing the pregnant person early enough that their opportunity to choose actual abortion is not compromised, and possibly subject to reasonable extra requirements to demonstrate that there indeed was consent only to sex, instead of parenthood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, rape only costs $300 of damage, because that’s the market cost of a sex worker.</p>
<p>Being forced into doing something often causes much, much more harm than choosing to do the thing voluntarily, even under otherwise identical circumstances– particularly in issues related to sex and reproduction. I am sure you can relate to this, as a person who had nonconsensual genital surgery yourself: the harm is not just “oh, I’m not able to get SRS which I probably wouldn’t have wanted anyway”, the harm is the sense of violation from having something done to your body that you did not consent to. There’s a <i>reason</i> that reproductive coercion is often deeply traumatizing. <br /></p>
<p>Conversely, child support is similar to taxes, which are burdensome but as far as I am aware have never caused anyone PTSD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know about people stressing out, year after year, about where they’re going to get their child support money. It seems reasonable that trauma which makes you have panic attacks for two decades can be compared to obligations which repeatedly descend upon you to inflict panic attacks for two decades. Especially since people who wind up in this situation are disproportionately likely to have poor planning/impulse control and probably aren’t the best at money-management. 

</p>
<p>I suspect that the least terrible harm-reduction measure around this issue would be a huge campaign in favour of more people getting abortions. If you can’t deal with an unplanned pregnancy without significantly curtailing a bystander’s freedom, maybe you shouldn’t be giving birth? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p><p>Ozy seems to have stealthed in two dubious assumptions in her post 1) that the person making the payments will be wealthier (and thus less likely to be forced into an unconformable position by financial circumstances) and 2) that not actively subsidizing the cost involved with going on with the pregnancy is equivalent to forcing an abortion. </p><p>Although I will add that I don’t think that ditching the current system (without at least adding some kind of replacement) will be a beneficial change. +1 the members of the ragbag of inefficient programs that could be replaced by a BIG. </p>
