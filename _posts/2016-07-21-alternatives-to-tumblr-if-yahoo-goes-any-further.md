<p>Reblogging cause one day it just may be neccessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we inch ever closer to destruction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine how many communities we’re going to invade and ruin when Tumblr gets shut down.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of those sites comes in HTTPS. Ick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://movim.eu/">https://movim.eu/</a><br /></p>

<p>I found this on the prism-break website; haven’t had time to examine it thoroughly but it seems at least possibly relevant for our interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would add that we need something hosted in the US of A for the speech protections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was about to say something about having the thing hosted somewhere with NSA protections but then remembered that they could just gather whatever info they want via ask memes so…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>US vs UK</p>
<p>NSA and good speech protection vs GCHQ and over-active libel laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not the UK. There are countries that aren’t in the 5, 9 or 14 eyes that still do have internet servers you know. The point of using a decentralized open-source non-corp platform is that rattumb could set up its own service under its own control with nobody to take away the refrigerated prunes.</p>
<p>(If it were solely up to me, I’d even make it an .onion to make really sure nobody snoops on our shitposts or steals our prunes.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we’re worried about different threat models (for good reasons - my life is different from yours)</p>
<p>I don’t actually worry about the police reading my tumblr looking for crime. I mean, I <i>should</i> but I haven’t the energy.</p>
<p>I worry about free speech - somebody taking offense at my posts and sending a subpoena to the host to find my identity. Here, check this:</p>
<p>“Hitler did nothing wrong”<br /></p>
<p>Now this post is illegal in Germany. <i>I don’t want this hosted on a German server</i>. And that’s not a dig on Germany in particular - we should also stay well away from my native Denmark.</p>
<p>America is a terrible country on many measures but on that exact one, Free Speech, it is #amazing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Onions. Or a decentralized platform run on the servers of some autistic freezepeach activist who would rather go to jail than let the guv’ment, or anyone, police people’s speech. With backups that are easy to migrate to if the police manage to pull the plug in one country. And surely there are countries with both prune protection and no NSA.</p>
<p>(If there aren’t, well, we need to start one. There’s this one island in the middle of the northernmost parts of the Baltic Sea which is only nominally ruled by the state of Finland while all actual sovereignty basically belongs to the leader-guy of the islet council who used to respond only to the king of Sweden and they may legally determine which laws and rules they will follow based on a still-valid mandate from the 18th century. And the island is still ruled according to the rules and procedures of the 18th century. Seriously, de jure it’s NRx heaven. People say it isn’t in the EU, others say it is, but the important thing is that there is actual severe ambiguity on the issue. Building some heavy fiber optics and satellite connections and a data centre on the island would be A++ excellent, if not for the fact that the islet council is so conservative that they wouldn’t allow it for it would mess up their idyllic islet aesthetics and the islet council’s rule is sovereign.)</p>
<p>And even if we get a US service, I still think we should go for a less-corpshit one because muh freedom. (And if we use a platform that’s under our control there won’t be the problem of it being once again bought and shut down by Yahoo.) Corps are a threat to privacy and will steal our prunes all the same. Facebook is known for manipulating political content. Paypal tries to trap sex workers (and pretty much everyone else who is sufficiently unpopular) and steal their money. Google knows your IRL identity.</p>
<p>(But seriously, onions. This is the exact thing onions are intended for. Good luck subpoenaing those, fuckers.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also there’s this one too: <a href="https://sandstorm.io/features">https://sandstorm.io</a></p>
<p>We could totally seek to build a better infrastructure that is immune to corp bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting find. Played with sandstorm’s online demo, and read its docs. Looks like a pretty neat way to manage web apps.</p>

<p>Although it does seem like it has a lot of rough edges. ie. logins only through external services, webapps needing to be rewritten for compatibility (introducing bugs), dependence on linux only features (no FreeBSD), etc. </p>
