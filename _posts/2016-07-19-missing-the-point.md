<p><span> </span>Alright, I just have to get this off my chest. One of the first things I posted on this blog was one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite books, Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card. And it actually got reblogged by people I don’t know, which is kind of cool.</p>
<p><span> </span>Then I saw that one of the rebloggers had added a caption, to the effect of Orson Scott Card being a hateful homophobe, and that you shouldn’t quote people if you don’t know who they are–with the heavy implication that Card’s political views invalidate the truth of the quote.</p>
<p>(For those of you who didn’t see the original, here’s the quote: “<span>No human being, when you understand his desires, is worthless. No one’s life is nothing. Even the most evil of men and women, if you understand their hearts, had some generous act that redeems them, at least a little, from their sins.”)</span></p>
<p><span> </span>Here’s the thing: I <em>do</em> know who Orson Scott Card is. I frequented the forums on his website for years. I was one of the many, many people there that praised his writing, but hated his politics. And I think, if anything, it’s his political views that <em>validate</em> the truth of that quote.</p>
<p><span> </span>Because, y'know what? Despite his abhorrent views on homosexuality, he wrote one of the most thoughtful, humanist, truthful pieces of literature I’ve ever read. Something inspired him to do that, to write a book that he’s literally spent most of his later career trying to mute and erase.</p>
<p><span> </span>But he wrote it anyway, for whatever reason. Does that absolve him of his hatred-filled diatribes? No. But it redeems him, just a bit, from his current views. At one point in his life, he created beauty–beauty and truth that help ME be pro-gay rights.</p>
<p><span> </span>So, long story short, I knew who he was when I posted that–and I posted it, to some degree, because of it. That is all.</p>

<p>It’s almost as if peoples’ political views are multifaceted and contain both good and bad ideas </p>
