<p>Something I’ve noticed about fascists/traditionalists/the extreme right is their willingness to accept some people into their community that aren’t WASPs. This isn’t because they’re genuinely trying to include them, but rather because they’re useful brickbat against the boogyman of the day. Whether it’s the Muslims or the Jews, or just to look nice to the public</p>

<p>But it’s fake; the moment they stop being useful they’ll be thrown back under the buss. If you look back as early as the 90s on the internet, old forums regard slavs as “subhuman mongol degenerates”, the LGBT community as “Cancerous and infectious” and anyone else who wasn’t them as contemptuous</p>

<p>This.</p>
<p>If you you look at the alt right, they like Milo because he agrees with them and they think he’s useful, they don’t really like gays at all otherwise.<br /></p>

<p>A pretty large segment of the alt-right <i>is</i> gay, though</p>
<p>It’s not a hive mind, it’s a catchall term for pretty much everyone who’s on the right (which is everyone who isn’t some flavor of communist, essentially) but not a mainstream conservative. The alt-right honestly covers far more ideological real estate than the entire Democratic and Republican parties combined</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, one of the distinctive things about the alt-right is that they don’t really care about your standard social issues (god, guns, and gays). They care about economic issues and immigration and foreign policy, but sometimes even agree with the left on things like gay marriage and abortion.  </p><p>This puts them in contrast to standard conservatives, and the standard far-right. I’ve repeatedly heard from the alt-right types I’ve seen that garden variety conservatives (ie. John Kasich) are “cuckservatives” that are letting America get humiliated while focusing on trivial distractions. </p><p>And the rest of the far right is different from the alt-right in that they are more than willing to object strongly to gay marriage (in France National Front supporters rioted after gay marriage passed), abortion and such, while still having the same opinions on the other issues as the alt-right. <br /></p>
