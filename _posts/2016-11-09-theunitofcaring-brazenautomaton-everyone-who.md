<p>everyone who is anxious over the possibility of a Trump win, remember</p>
<p>this is not the fault of a large, uncoordinated mass of voters. this is not the fault of Shadowy Evil White Men.</p>
<p>this is the fault of the Democratic party, for managing to lose to an obviously unfit, emotionally-fragile psychopath. their job is to put out a candidate that people vote for. they decided to anoint a nominee – rigging the primary process to do so – who people did not want to vote for. She decided to run a campaign that centered around her charisma (despite not having any), personality, and identity, rather than offering a unifying message or vision. Fuck, Obama was merely an extension of Bush II’s policies, but he managed to run a campaign that got people excited!</p>
<p>Those decisions had consequences. The consequences of those decisions made by the Democratic leadership were that their candidate came perilously close to losing, and maybe did lose. Those decisions were <i>theirs</i>. The decisions were made by <i>them</i>. The consequences are <i>theirs</i>. The consequences belong to <i>them. </i></p>
<p>You say this result will mean horrible things for minorities or LGBT people? <i>That is a result of the Democratic leadership’s actions. They did this. It was them. It is their action. It is their consequence.</i></p>
<p>They will attempt to blame everyone but themselves for the consequences of <i>their own</i> actions, the consequences that come from them and are bound to them. They will say it is unfair and wrong for their actions to have consequences, and it is the responsibility of everyone else in the world to save them from their actions having consequences. </p>
<p>Do not fall for it.</p>

<p>This is the fault of the people who voted for an obviously unfit, emotionally-fragile psychopath. Efforts to blame it on the Democratic party, on Gary Johnson, on Stein voters, on people who stayed home, all fundamentally miss the point. Yes, everyone could have done things differently that would have reduced the probability of this happening.</p>
<p>But this happened because so many Americans chose to cast their vote for the obviously unfit, emotionally-fragile psychopath. It is astonishing to me how the blame game has focused on everyone but them. People who voted for Trump did wrong, and they are culpable for that wrong, and they are the reason Trump is our next president, and I am tired of the lengths people are going to blame literally anyone other than them. </p>
