<p>The GMO issue is often treated, even by those who accept the <a href="http://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/the-solid-gmo-scientific-consensus/">consensus viewpoint that GMOs are safe</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/why-the-anti-gmo-movement-is-dangerous/#en-919-1" id="enref-919-1">1</a></sup>, as a relatively trivial issue when compared to other science issues like climate change. However, the benefits of GMOs are very large, and the cost of the anti-GMO movement’s ability to damage the deployment of these technologies is great. Current technology has proven the ability to increase crop yields by over 20 percent, meaning that removing GMO crops from the market will have a similar effect on food production as a 3C increase in global temperatures. Genetic modification also has the ability to reduce other forms of environmental damage, such as land use changes. Its time to treat this as a serious issue. </p>
<p>In a 2014 study published in the journal <em>PLoS One</em> titled “A meta-analysis of the impacts of genetically modified crops.”, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629">Klümper et. al found that</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/why-the-anti-gmo-movement-is-dangerous/#en-919-2" id="enref-919-2">2</a></sup> “GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%”. This study was a meta-analysis that brought together data from 147 other studies on the subject. Higher quality, peer-reviewed studies tended to come to the conclusion of higher yield increases, than non-peer reviewed studies. The studies that estimated the lowest yield increases tended to originate from think-tanks, NGOs and “outspoken biotechnology critics”. The 22% crop yield increase number includes both the peer-reviewed, and non-peer reviewed studies. Including only the peer reviewed studies results in a yield increase estimate of 25.5 percent. Among these studies Klümper et. al. did not find a significant correlation between funding source and predicted yield increase.  They looked for evidence of publication bias using the funnel-plot method. They found no evidence of publication bias towards higher yields among journals, however, “The mean values shown in these funnel plots suggest somewhat stronger effects of GM crops,implying that the main results are rather conservative estimates.”. Ie. to the extent that there is any evidence of publication bias it serves to make GMO yields look <em>worse</em> than they should. However, Klümper et. al maintain that results regarding publication bias are highly tentative. </p>
<p>As an example of the studies aggregated by Klümper et. al take <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/299/5608/900.full.pdf+html">Qaim et. al’s</a> 2008 paper published in <em>Science</em> “Yield effects of genetically modified crops in developing countries.”. <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/why-the-anti-gmo-movement-is-dangerous/#en-919-3" id="enref-919-3">3</a></sup> This study found that the insect resistant BT variety of cotton produced 1501 kilograms of cotton per hectare (Sd=857), while the unmodified cotton yielded 833 kg/hectare (Sd=572). The correlation between yield and type of cotton is significant to the 5% significance level. The effect of the plant type depended on location (due to variation in the local insect population). The strongest effects were found in sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
<p>For comparison, lets look at the estimated effect that climate change has on crop yields. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15594.full.pdf">Schlenker et. al in a 2009 paper</a> in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/why-the-anti-gmo-movement-is-dangerous/#en-919-4" id="enref-919-4">4</a></sup> found yield effects of 30-46% under the IPCC B1 model, which has peak warming of approximately 3C (The more severe A1FI model results in even higher crop losses). However, Schlenker et. al. make pessimistic assumptions, and assume crops will not be moved in response to temperature changes. A follow up letter made in the same journal by Meerburg et. al note these issues. <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/why-the-anti-gmo-movement-is-dangerous/#en-919-5" id="enref-919-5">5</a></sup> Meerburg et. al also note that genetic modification technologies have strong potential to aleviate and possibily eliminate many of the issues that cause reduced crop yields.</p>
<p>This data indicates that the use of GMO crops increases yields by between 22%-and 25%. This is similar in magnitude to the impact of 3C climate change on crop yields, and thus can be treated as a very important shift in crop yields. The use of GMO crops also has a strong role to play in climate change adaptation, and limiting the development of these crops has the potential to greatly worsen the damage caused by climate change. Additionally, the increase in crop yields has the potential to reduce the amount of land that needs to be diverted to agricultural use, and has the potential to <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5967/812">greatly improve global food security</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/why-the-anti-gmo-movement-is-dangerous/#en-919-6" id="enref-919-6">6</a></sup> and reduce global poverty. </p>
