<p>Okay, so with the Trump thing, it’s a good time to raise a point I’ve long wanted to raise - as people keep discussing how accepted rape culture is, where and to what extent - maybe it illustrates that the oft-mocked “Not all men” frequently <i>does </i>make sense when talking about wide-scale issues? Even though often raised in bad faith/out of context, whatever?</p>
<p>Like, one way or another “Yes all men”/”Not all men” is a claim about society/some parts of it, and how true it is matters, and the specifics matter? Is that not what<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/56s4zr/athletes_are_saying_they_dont_hear_sexual_assault/"> discussions like these</a> are about?<br /></p>

<p>Agreed. The blaming <i>everyone</i> is a troublesome political tactic. </p><p>However, I have become a <i>lot</i> more sympathetic to the feminist line on this type of issue since the Trump tapes dropped. A week ago I would not have thought many otherwise well-adjusted people would find that behaviour anything but reprehensible. But there seem to be a whole lot of such people.  </p><p>And even the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a730vEbqpSo">GOP response</a> on this has brought out some <i>interesting</i> if you will opinions from the left. </p>
