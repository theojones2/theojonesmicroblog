<p>I wonder from where so many Americans get the idea that voting is supposed to be some expression of your deepest, most beloved values and virtues rather than a pragmatic, political move meant to shift your country as much closer to your ideal as possible. This strikes me as another example of extreme individualism. Voting isn’t about *you*. It’s about your city, state, and/or country. It doesn’t have to feel transcendently good deep down in your bones. It just has to *do* as much good as you can do, in this particular moment in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to know where so many Americans get the idea that the only defensible consequentialist position is to only consider the results of the current election without considering what the success or failure of a candidate will mean for party nominations going forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because there will be a lot more shit to clean up (in consequentialist: BAD CONSEQUENCES) if an openly authoritarian xenophobe gains power?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m in line to vote for Clinton as I write this post.  </p>
<p>But I still think voting 3rd party is defensible, and at that point we’re having an argument over the facts of the matter - how important it is that the democrats never again nominate someone as compromised as her, versus the harms of a Trump presidency, modulated by how likely it is that the dems are to seek the protest vote versus how likely Trump is to win because of them.  But the important thing to note is that it’s a disputed over likely effects, not over consequentialism as such.  You can accuse such third party voters being naive or having a bad evaluation of the facts, but you can’t accuse them of prioritizing personal expression over the common good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That depends on what they’re doing. If they “just can’t pull the lever for her,” then yes – that’s personal purity. And personal purity is not what should decide elections, and it’s romanticism to think it is.</p>
<p>If they actually think that Trump winning will force a housecleaning, and this really does have nothing to do with their own disgust, well, then that’s just being wrong. In a way that will ruin many lives and probably get some people killed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accelerationism is the weakest consequentialist argument.  It’s also not the one I’ve advanced.</p>
<p>Put it to you this way: what do you think the gay lobby would do if Clinton had voted for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in 2003, been defeated by Obama in 08 in part because of it, then was a high-ranking cabinet member in an Obama administration that repealed workplace protections and provided federal funding for reparative therapy?</p>
<p>That’s more or less Clinton’s record on civil liberties and foreign policy from the perspective of the doves. (The issues being Iraq, Libya, and the drone program respectively)</p>
<p>So I do think there’s a case for just holding your nose and voting Clinton anyway, since the Republicans would be worse.  But I think there’s also a case for concluding that interest groups that don’t make noise get ignored and that if there’s no incentive not to keep throwing your interests under the bus politicians will be happy to do just that.  So you spend your limited political capital on ensuring a better nominee four years down the line than a better president now.</p>
<p>Yeah, the response is “but trump is really that bad,” and I agree, that’s why I’m holding my nose and voting for someone that advocates for the extrajudicial execution of American citizens.  But again, that’s not proof that the third party voter doesn’t care about the consequences.  Also, if that’s the case, democrats should really hold that card in reserve for when they need it rather than chucking it around indiscriminately every four years (or pretend that Gore would have been any more than marginally better than bush).  The current inability to corral third party voters has come about in large part because the Dems have cried wolf every election cycle until now, and nobody believes us now that it’s actually true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I honestly don’t recall who advanced it, and don’t feel like wading back through that cesspit. But it was definitely one of the things being said to me when I first worried that voting third party would throw the election: “So what? A Trump win would force the Democrats to confront that they’ve never been there for me!”</p>
<p>Which… how the hell can you be sure when they go back and look at losing they’ll go “oh those particular policy positions favored by that ONE GUY, if only…!”</p>
<p>But as far as what you’re saying, I’ve said it before and apparently before the polls close I’m going to be saying it again: choosing a President is about choosing the most qualified person for the job. Choosing an unqualified person courts disaster.</p>
<p>Choosing an unqualified person who stands no chance of winning on top of all that isn’t a sly fox Rube Goldberg way of unlocking the Secret Consequences Jackpot. It’s idiocy.</p>

<p>This thread does a lot to reinforce my opinion that the Bernie or Bust 3rd party voting is just a product of 1) the meme that the primary was RIGGED, and 2) the KILLARY IS CORPORATE $HILL meme. </p>
<p>And its bullshit.  Bernie lost the primary because the great bulk of the democratic party didn’t like his platform and because he is way to. He lost the popular vote by a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/was-the-democratic-primary-a-close-call-or-a-landslide/">landslide 12% margin</a>. Bernie couldn’t get the support of a number of essential groups such as minorities, centrist democrats and working class democrats. He really only had a core demographic of young middle class whites, and you can’t win an election with that. <br /><br /></p>
<p>If <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-system-isnt-rigged-against-sanders/">anything the system was tilted in Bernie’s </a>favor. <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hillary-clinton-clinches-democratic-nomination-according-to-ap/">He won a greater share of the delegates than the popular vote</a>. States with arcane caucuses favored Bernie (Washington state had both a caucus and a primary Clinton won the higher turnout primary, but bernie won the caucus).<br /></p>
<p>And Bernie would have done terrible in the general election. He has a lot of baggage which would have <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/5/10923304/bernie-sanders-general-election">destroyed him in the general election</a> (particularly if paired with a Kasich-type moderate). He is well to the left of the median voter, and would have given the GOP a golden opportunity to pull off centrists from the Dems.</p>
<p>And the Berners did wind up getting a lot of their idiotic ideas conceded to them due to the DNC’s attempts to appease them. They destroyed the TPP, which would of been one of Obama’s best foreign policy accomplishments, going against both the advice, damaging the U.S standing abroad as evidenced by <a href="http://time.com/4545407/lee-hsien-loong-singapore-globalization/">this  interview with Singapore’s prime minister</a> in <i>Time</i> . They got their $15 wage added to the platform (despite the insistence of the Dems’ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/the-minimum-wage-how-much-is-too-much.html?_r=0">economists</a> and policy advisors that anything above 12$ is hard to justify as net beneficial based on the available evidence). </p>
<p>And they got some of their less idiotic ideas like their college reforms integrated into Hillary’s proposals. </p>
<p>So, yah, if the dems do lose due to Bernie or Bust types, it will change the type of nominees you get. It will make most of the Democratic party realize that the Berners are incorrigible extremists, and it is effectively impossible to build a collation that can win an election that includes them. So, they will realize that the optimal choice is to let them Bern in hell, and instead to nominate moderates that have a chance of appealing to McMullan type conservatives. You will get about the opposite of what you want. </p>

<p>And if you don&rsquo;t belive me on how terrible a general election canidate Bernie would have been, lets take a minute to go though some of Bernie Sanders&rsquo; Greatest and Most Timeless Quotes and think about how the GOP could use these aganist him (even though, yes, some of them are out dated).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4e1qaq/bernie_sanders_greatest_and_most_timeless_quotes/">A window into the mind of the man whose values have stayed consistent his entire life</a></p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in charities.&rdquo;</strong> | 1981 | <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/19/nyregion/notes-on-people-some-disunity-along-the-united-way.html#pq=GTBW90">New York Times</a> | As mayor, he said this at a fundraising drive.  He &ldquo;went on to question the &lsquo;fundamental concepts on which charities are based&rsquo; and contended that government, rather than charity organizations, should take over responsibility for social programs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>It’s funny, sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is, that people are lining up for food. That is a good thing!</strong> In other countries people don’t line up for food: the rich get the food and the poor starve to death.&rdquo; | 1985 | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJBjjP8WSbc">Video</a> | This quote refers to the &ldquo;bread lines&rdquo; often discussed by journalists during the Cold War, in which people in the USSR would often stand in long lines to receive their apportioned food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s similar to what the Secretary said. <strong>When you&rsquo;re white, you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be living in a ghetto. You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be poor.</strong>| 2015 | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6IlGoeDIUQ">Video</a> | Said during a debate in answer to a question about what racial blind spots the candidates have.</p>

<p>“<strong>I have my own feelings about what causes cancer and the psychosomatic aspects of cancer.</strong> One wonders if the war did not claim another victim of another person who couldn’t deal with her <strong>tremendous grief and suffering</strong> that’s going on in her own country.” | 1988 | <a href="http://time.com/4249034/bernie-sanders-alternative-medicine-cancer/">TIME</a> | &quot;He pointed to Nora Astorga, a Sandanista politician who visited Burlington in 1987 and later died of cervical cancer. Sanders proposed that Astorga’s cancer was caused by grief from her experiences in the war in Nicaragua.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;The manner in which you bring up your daughter with regard to sexual attitudes may very well determine whether or not she will develope (sic) breast cancer, among other things.&rdquo;</strong>| 1969 | <a href="http://time.com/4249034/bernie-sanders-alternative-medicine-cancer/">TIME</a> | &ldquo;Sanders believed that cultural forces were driving Americans to illness and that sexual repression caused cancer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously.&rdquo;</strong> | 1972 | <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/29/410606045/the-bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-explained">NPR</a> | This quote was from an essay about gender norms written by Sanders in an alternative newspaper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever looked at the Stag, Man, Hero, Tough magazines on the shelf of your local bookstore? <strong>Do you know why the newspaper with the articles like 'Girl 12 raped by 14 men&rsquo; sell so well? To what in us are they appealing?</strong>&rdquo;|1972|<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/29/410606045/the-bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-explained">NPR</a>|This quote was from an essay about gender norms written by Sanders in an alternative newspaper.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or of 18 different pairs of sneakers when children are hungry in this country.&rdquo;</strong> | 2015 | <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/26/10-questions-with-bernie-sanders.html">CNBC</a> | Diversity of American brands and products is something that is often used as a way to differentiate American markets from those of other countries where there may be only one or two brands of a particular consumer product. Here, Sanders argues against the necessity of that diversity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>Everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world. All the Cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against Fidel Castro. They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.</strong> You know, not to say that Fidel Castro or Cuba are perfect, they are certainly not. But just because Ronald Reagan dislikes these people does not mean to say that the people in their own nations feel the same way. | 1985 | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E14lsC4WLV0">Video</a> | Sanders made this statement in a local TV interview.</p>

<p>&quot;And she has been saying lately that she thinks that I am, quote-unquote not qualified to be president. <strong>Well let me just say in response to Secretary Clinton - I don&rsquo;t believe that she is qualified</strong> if she is through her SuperPAC taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds &hellip; I don&rsquo;t think you are qualified if you have supported virtually every disastrous trade agreement which has cost us millions of decent paying jobs.&rdquo;|2016|<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vht0NWT9qOQ">Video</a>|Said at a rally speech. Sanders lays out several requirements for being qualified to be President.</p>

<p><strong>“I believe that, in the long run, major industries in this state and nation should be publicly owned and controlled by the workers themselves.”</strong> | 1976 | <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/bernie-sanders-socialist-surge-119785">Politico</a> | &mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Banking industry executives must no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed’s boards and to handpick its members and staff. <strong>Board positions should instead include representatives from all walks of life — including labor, consumers, homeowners, urban residents, farmers and small businesses.</strong>&rdquo; | 2015 | <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/opinion/bernie-sanders-to-rein-in-wall-street-fix-the-fed.html?_r=1">New York Times</a> | One of Bernie Sanders&rsquo; suggested reforms in his editorial about the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>As a rule, the Fed should not raise interest rates until unemployment is lower than 4 percent.</strong> Raising rates must be done only as a last resort — not to fight phantom inflation.&rdquo;|2015|<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/opinion/bernie-sanders-to-rein-in-wall-street-fix-the-fed.html?_r=1">New York Times</a> | One of Bernie Sanders&rsquo; suggested reforms in his editorial about the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>The revolution comes</strong> when two strangers smile at each other, <strong>when a father refuses to send his child to school because schools destroy children, when a commune is started and people begin to trust each other,</strong> when a young man refuses to go to war, and when a girl pushes aside all that her mother has 'taught&rsquo; her and accepts her boyfriend&rsquo;s love.&rdquo; | 1969 | <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2157415-sanders-revolution.html">Direct Link to Essay</a> | One of Sanders&rsquo; several essays in alternative newspapers during this time.</p>
