post_title: 'So you, in general, want bigots to have a place where they feel safe? Does that extend to a place where only white people can go? (Different anon, and honestly interested in your answer. Also, I don&#8217;t think the only reason people want to not see kissing is bigotry, but I do think the only reason people want to not see any people of color is bigotry. Not that that automatically means they shouldn&#8217;t have a place for that, but it does make me skeptical that it would do more good than harm.)'

<blockquote><p>To me there’s a difference between what <i>norms a space has</i> and what <i>people a space lets in</i>. Some spaces will be only for members of group [X] and sometimes that’s okay but it’s totally reasonable to criticize it or challenge it or debate who ought to be considered an [X] or judge people for their preference for groups that only let [X]s in. </p><p>Whereas I think it’s in general a bad idea to debate whether a group norm for a group you’re not in is Real and Valid and whether people who want that norm need to Get Over Themselves.</p><p>I also think It’s fair to say ‘well, regardless of whether that’s a real and valid need or whether you could get over it, it’s not happening in any community I’m part of’. It’s the ‘I’d respect a legitimate need but your need isn’t legitimate’ bit that’s unproductive. it’s really hard from the outside, except in extreme cases, to judge a legitimate need, and people are quick to decide everyone else’s needs are illegitimate. Erring on the other side works better. </p></blockquote>
<p>I think I’ve expressed before my hypothesis that one of the things driving some aspects of the toxicity in the SJ movement (hardly the only one, but I do think this one is important) is the everything-maximally-intersectional-all-the-time! ethos.</p>
<p>Because if every legitimate need must be accommodated, not just somewhere but <i>everywhere</i>, then any time there is an irresolvable conflict of needs, one or the other has to be declared illegitimate, and therefore unworthy of accommodation <i>anywhere.</i><br /></p>
