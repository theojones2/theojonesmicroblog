<p>so Tim Kaine is Catholic, and believes that abortion is wrong but that it ought to be legal and access ought to be protected. I talked with someone today who felt very strongly that this is Not Good Enough, that ‘it’s wrong but I’ll let you do it anyway’ cannot possibly be confidence-inspiring for people worried about reproductive rights and that it’s reasonable to insist on Democratic candidates that hold that abortion is fine, not just that it’s a sin one should be not be impeded in committing.</p>
<p>and I have a lot of respect for that perspective, but also I cannot think of any trait more important to me in politicians than the willingness to say “I think that this is wrong and I have no business making laws about it.” There are lots of things that are morally wrong but should totally be legal, because <i>prison is also morally wrong,</i> and our bar for ‘worth outlawing’ should be set very, very high. </p>
<p>So I find it very reassuring that Tim Kaine thinks abortion is wrong and abortion rights matter; it’s from that vein of thought that we will eventually get drugs and sex work legalized and eventually build a society with less of a mass incarceration problem. It is critically necessary to build a society where people who genuinely have deep-seated moral disagreements can actually live side-by-side. <br /></p>

<p>I kind of feel the opposite. Unless he has some weird moral philosophy I don’t know about, the main reason for being pro-life is that you think fetuses are full human beings with souls and minds and that aborting them is literally murder and just as bad as killing anyone else. If you think that an act is murder, but you won’t pass laws against it because it would make you a bad member of your political party, that’s pretty scary.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this means Kaine will <i>always</i> lack the courage of his convictions when those convictions might be unpopular, but it sure sounds like a risk factor.</p>
<p>I think it’s important that you be willing to <i>follow</i> and <i>tolerate</i> laws that you disagree with, but if you’re making the laws, what do you base them on other than your convictions?</p>
<p>Also, welcome back!<br /></p>

<p>I agree with this to a degree.</p><p> However, considering some of the more common arguments made in-favor of abortion rights, I think most a lot of the pro-choice people criticizing Tim Kaine have very weak standing to make that type of argument, at least until they revisit some of their other arguments.</p><p>The following two arguments are inconsistent:</p><p>1.  Banning abortion is <i>legislating morality</i>. Its inflicting arbitrary religious views on others. </p><p>2. Believing abortion is morally wrong but not wanting it banned makes you a dangerous hypocrite. </p>
