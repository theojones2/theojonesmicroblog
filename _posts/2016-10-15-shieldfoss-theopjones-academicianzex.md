This seems like it would be better solved with auto-transcription software or the like.

<p>I know this is Old Discourse by now but: If We, the People, feel like this is a thing that should happen, We, the People, should pay for it.</p>
<p>The <i>worst</i> kind of budgeting is the kind that is made like this: “This is a problem, where’s the nearest rich institution we can force to deal with it?” because rich institutions become that way by being good at not spending the money they make.</p>
<ul><li>People cannot live on $x an hour, let us force companies to pay people at least $x+y an hour.<br /></li>
<li>
<i>Oh look, now companies are replacing people with automation</i><br /></li>
<li>Poor people cannot afford houses, let us force banks to loan them money</li>
<li><i>Oh look, now banks are doing all kinds of manipulation to make bad loans look good</i></li>
<li>It is too difficult to find parking in the city, let us force all new developments to have space for at least two cars per dwelling</li>
<li><i>Oh look, now all new developments are hellholes because costs need to be cut elsewhere (A marginal parking space costs $20,000. Yes really.)</i></li>
</ul><p>It doesn’t work. It never works. People think “If people do X, force them to do Y also” and believe this means they’ll get more Y for free. No, you’ll get less X, and the X you get will be more expensive because it also has to pay for Y.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t that apply to basically all disability accommodations?  Making stuff wheelchair accessible may have made every building do the X + Y thing, but afaik it’s been pretty successful.    And maybe we do get less X but in that case I think we able bodied people can take one for the team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yah. </p>
<p>Although shieldfoss does have a point, even though he goes too far in saying that regulations of that form never work and don’t work. People way too often think that regulatory mandates are a source of free shit because the costs of them are hidden. But the costs didn’t go away, and might actually be more than if the government paid for it directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of the word “never” is definitely hyperbole on my part, yes. But to answer @academicianzex: I am of the opinion that if We, the People, believe that every store should be handicap-accessible, then We, the People, should pay for that directly.</p>
<p>I am OK with a variety of different forms of taxes to raise money to spend on things We, the People, want to buy, but the money should be raised and spent. Forcing other parties to spend that money makes it completely impossible to find out whether, in general, any law is worth the cost - we’ll just be bafflingly short of whatever thing we are disincentivizing with no idea why.</p>
<p>How many people have lost their jobs due to minimum wage? Who knows. How many excess houses have been built because banks were incentivized to make bad loans? Who knows. How many apartments are we we down in the inner city because of parking requirements? Who knows.</p>

<blockquote><p>“ I am of the opinion that if We, the People, believe that every store should be handicap-accessible, then We, the People, should pay for that directly.” <br /></p></blockquote><p>It’s not automatic here that the deadweight loss and inefficiency of a subsidy-based system is going to be less than the current system. There are two big sources of inefficiency here 1) the regulation will sometimes be inefficiently strict ie. it will do what happened in the case of the college lecture videos, and 2) it will be inefficiently lax ie. you could have a business where there is a lot of improvement of accessibility possible at a reasonable cost, but the business does the most half-assed job needed to meet the regulatory requirements. A subsidy based approach might still have those issues (ie. a business would do the minimum needed to get the subsidy, or a thing where accomdentation isn’t very important could still get subsidized), but would also bring up a third issue &mdash; how do you set the level of subsidy needed, ie. how do you prevent service providers from inflating their costs?</p><p>I’m not convinced a subsidy-based approach to the ADA would be fundamentally better than the current approach.  </p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>“How many people have lost their jobs due to minimum wage?

These issues have been extensively studied, and yes there is pretty good evidence as to the effects of the policies</p><p><b>Minimum wage? </b>Its one of the most studied issues in microeconomics. The academic research on the subject (see for instance, this literature review <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663">http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663</a> ) is converging on a demand elastisity of about -0.2 for low wage labor. With the main academic dispute being about if price setting power is strong enough at the low end of the labor market for there to be a net neutral effect on employment. </p><p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/designing-thoughtful-minimum-wage-policy-at-the-state-and-local-levels/">Indicating that</a> (if the ETIC and similar policies are off limits) there could be an optimal (ie. maximally poverty reducing minimum wage that balances the tradeoffs between higher unemployment and increased income for workers) at around 40%-50% of the median wage. </p><p><b>Banks?</b> I assume you are referring to the The Community Reinvestment Act. Which despite the popular attention it has received actually had fairly little to do with financial stability, and affected a relatively small number of loans.
