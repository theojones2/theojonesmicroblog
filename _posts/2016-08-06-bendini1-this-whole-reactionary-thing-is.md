<blockquote>
<p>This whole reactionary thing is grasping at something, something that feels very important. It seems to be an aim to redissolve the ennui precipitated by modern life.</p>
<p>But as with modern life, when constructing an ideology, there is the sense that somewhere along the way they ended up rather lost. </p>
<p>Attempting to turn liberal cosmopolitans back into god-fearing peasants is not going to happen. Expecting anyone but the most aesthetic-loving countersignalling weirdos to turn their backs on the perks of the globalised world after they have sampled its offerings is a non-starter.  </p>
<p>There is a lot to unpack in reactionary philosophy. Even if you grant the dubious claim that all of whig history is a lie, the proposed solution is so low entropy that it is unfeasible. The idea that a monarch could implement true cultural reform when even North Korea can’t stop it’s citizenry from watching western DVDs with the threat of internment camps. Even with draconian laws, there is no way you can put the toothpaste back in the tube in terms of modernity, Moloch will not allow it.</p>
<p>If you can’t make unwilling reactionaries, what about creating true believers?</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I have any reactionary followers into evangelism, I imagine it’s quite a hard thing to actively sell. I don’t even know how I would go about selling it to myself</p>
<p>How would I go about convincing myself to become catholic for personal utility reasons when I know, deep down, that the whole thing is made up. When, due to the fact urbanised Britain has had a de-facto atheist majority for 2 generations, there isn’t a god shaped hole to fill. Unlike America, where there are enough people longing for something to worship again that social justice and Scientology have spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Why would I, as a gender transgressive person who fucks girls with nose rings and dates apolitical girls who favour egalitarian gender roles, have to gain by going back to the old ways of courtship and traditional gender roles? These things fit neither me nor the people I like to date</p>
<p>If you can’t make an honest case for why anyone who has the intellectual capacity to consciously choose a lifestyle philosophy should adopt a reactionary one, how are the masses (who in theory, stand to benefit the most from them) going to be converted?</p>
<p>(ps. if anyone is willing to teach me how to structure and improve these short essays it would be much appreciated, I never know if I’m actually communicating my thoughts or if this is going to get most of it’s notes solely on the fact that this is basically a “boo nrx” post) </p>

<p>Looking at that NRx meme, it’s interesting how its style looks a lot like some left-wing stuff. Bucolic pasture. “Revere the local”.  </p><p><br /></p><p>Reminds me of this</p><p><a href="https://vpostrel.com/future-and-its-enemies">https://vpostrel.com/future-and-its-enemies</a><br /></p><blockquote><p>In The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise, and Progress,first published in November 1998, Virginia Postrel explodes this myth, embarking on a bold exploration of how progress really occurs. In areas of endeavor ranging from fashion to fisheries, from movies to medicine, from contact lenses to computers, she shows how and why unplanned, open-ended trial and error - not conformity to one central vision - is the key to human betterment. Thus, the true enemies of humanity&rsquo;s future are those who insist on prescribing outcomes in advance, circumventing the process of competition and experiment in favor of their own preconceptions and prejudices.</p><p>Postrel argues that these conflicting views of progress, rather than the traditional left and right, increasingly define our political and cultural debate. On one side, she identifies a collection of strange bedfellows: Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader standing shoulder to shoulder against international trade; &ldquo;right-wing&rdquo; nativists and &ldquo;left-wing&rdquo; environmentalists opposing immigration; traditionalists and technocrats denouncing Wal-Mart, biotechnology, the Internet, and suburban &ldquo;sprawl.&rdquo; Some prefer a pre-industrial past, while others envision a bureaucratically engineered future, but all share a devotion to what she calls &ldquo;stasis,&rdquo; a controlled, uniform society that changes only with permission from some central authority.</p></blockquote>
