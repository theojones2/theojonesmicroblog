<p>I’m so uncomfortable with the idea that because the men who tried to intimidate HRC into not taking her law school exam were subject to the draft and she wasn’t, their trying to intimidate her and another woman into not finishing their education was “not sexism.”</p>

<p>Like, I get that feminists have a track record of being total dumbasses wrt risks to men that women don’t share. I agree!</p>

<p>But the idea that she should have just up and left smacks of… Well, it sounds like the worst of SJ, honestly.</p>

<p>“If you were really a good ally, you would have left. Or at least you would never have told anyone how that affected you. Because a good ally knows who’s really oppressed.”</p>

<p>Some of y'all sound an awful lot like what you hate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely don’t think she should have up and left. That’s a burden she’s not obligated to shoulder. I do think, though, that people are correct in criticizing application of the world “entitlement” to the situation. While the effect on others may be the same, there’s still a big difference between lashing out from a place of fear and hurt and lashing out from a place of entitlement and arrogance. I have sympathy for both sides in that situation. <br /></p>

<p>So do I! And I’m not entirely sure HRC was saying “these guys were so baaaaaad” herself. She very well could have been, but it sounded a lot more like she was just saying she had to stand her ground and not show her emotions.</p>
<p>But I’m troubled by “she shouldn’t use that example.” Because it is an example! </p>
<p>It would be like saying to me I shouldn’t talk about my abusive exgf because she was black, and to “go find some other example” of domestic abuse I experienced, preferably at the hands of white men.</p>
<p>Small problem: the white men I dated were not abusers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I find that troubling too. There will never be “perfect” examples of abuse or sexism or oppression, because people’s lives aren’t textbooks. There are always complicating factors. Narratives exist for people, not vice versa. <br /></p>
<p>Honestly it kind of sounds like “don’t ever say you were hurt by someone’s mental illness”. I have a lot of sympathy for people who suffer, say, out-of-control rages, but that doesn’t mean I can magically make them not affect me. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. However, it is jerk behavior that is not helpful to productive political discourse.  </p><p>@

<br /></p><p>Fully agreed here. There is a lot of that story that looks like an inverted version of some of the worst elements of modern campus activist SJ. There is something about gender issues and gender-adjacent issues that are magnetic to this type of behavior. In effect blaming your problems on the nearest member of $gender.   </p>
