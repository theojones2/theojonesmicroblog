<blockquote>
<p>The principle behind GiveDirectly and other cash-transfer charities is that people know how best to spend their money to get what they need, so giving them money will pretty much always work better than giving them stuff.</p>
<p>Even if you think a distant charitable organization could actually look at someone’s life and figure out what they need more effectively than they can do it themselves, the overhead of doing this individually would be ridiculous; instead, give-people-stuff charities are looking at whole populations and figuring out what stuff is most needed across the population, which means it’ll presumably often go to people who don’t need it or who need other things much more badly.</p>
<p>I think this argument makes a lot of sense and I am very enthusiastic about cash transfer charities. But GiveWell’s best estimate is that the Against Malaria Foundation is about ten times as effective. I think their estimate is pretty accurate (and if anything, may understate the difference), but the question is: why? If malaria nets are the best thing for people, why aren’t they what people buy with cash transfers? If they’re not what people buy with cash transfers, isn’t it surprising they’re the best thing for people?</p>
<p>As far as I know there are a couple explanations. One is that the countries where AMF does distributions, like Malawi, are way poorer than Kenya, where GiveDirectly primarily operates. They are in fact so poor that cash transfers don’t work - there’s no financial infrastructure in place to give people money the way GiveDirectly does it, or make sure it doesn’t just get stolen from them. (<a href="http://www.wave.com">Wave’</a>s expanding the number of countries that have this financial infrastructure; that’ll make cash transfers more viable.)</p>
<p>Another one is externalities: falling malaria rates mean fewer mosquitos carry the parasite and you’re less likely to catch malaria even if you don’t yourself have a net. GiveWell <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/30/giving-cash-versus-giving-bednets/">at one point modeled</a> externalities as half the benefits of community-wide net distribution.</p>
<p>Another one GiveWell mentions in that same article is that most people who die of malaria are young children, and they generally aren’t the ones making the purchasing decisions in the household.</p>
<p>The last one gives me a bit more pause - it’s that, because there are lots of charities that do net distribution, people may expect to get nets for free and may not be willing to pay for them (or nets may not be for sale locally). This one worries me. If peoples’ purchasing decisions and which things there’s a market for are being affected by free net distributions, that seems like something worth keeping an eye out for, especially if there were any reason to think free net distributions wouldn’t be sustained indefinitely. </p>
<p>I am currently tentatively inclined to bet that if cash transfers were possible in the poorest countries in the world they’d be closer to competitive with the best of health interventions, though nets will still be better if that 50%-of-the-benefit-is-externalities figure is borne out by more research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then there is the corruption issue. It’s worth noting that GiveDirectly works in Kenya and Uganda, which are (relatively) democratic and non-corrupt. If you tried that in a country ruled by a more authoritarian government, then a lot of the money would get stolen. Bednets are good because they have low economic value, so they aren’t good to steal and resell. The aid will actually reach the intended recipients. </p>
