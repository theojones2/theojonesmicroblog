<p>Theyre….advocating…for free unpaid labor??? Am I misinterpreting or??????? What kind of bullshit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’re advocating for low skill workers to have jobs, as they’re the ones that are disproportionately affected by the job loss that comes with minimum wages. Obviously, no one would be forced to work for someone for free, unless they felt like it. Little commie up there with the picture is trying to imply that without government, we would all somehow be crushed by the corporations that none of us would want to work for, even though, without central regulation to keep newcomers from entering the market and offering fair wages, there would be huge numbers of newcomers entering the market  and offering fair wages, and the corporations would quickly wither away unless they adjusted their policies to be as attractive to workers as those smaller businesses.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But people are already forced to work for wages that are too low to properly live on. Because the alternative is exposure, dehydration and starvation.</p>
<p>Where are these newcomers with the capital to offer good wages coming from? And why would they bother offering fair wages when it’s more profitable not to?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. Actual reasonable questions. <br /></p>
<p>Basically, you need to deregulate business. remove all the fines, fees, licenses, permits, forms, taxes, and inspections that make it so damn difficult  to start your own business. Do that, and suddenly, a bunch of people who work for those horrible corporations will say “fuck this shit I’ve got a skill I’m gonna sell it directly to the customers” and start their own business. And without all that bureaucratic bullshit to block them and shut them down, they’ll do it, and lots of them will be successful. And then, they’ll start wanting a day off, which is hard when you’re the only person working for you. <br /></p>
<p>So, they’ll want to hire someone to do some work, so that they can get more than four hours of sleep a night and maybe have a day off once a week or so. So they go hiring. And they find that there are a LOT fewer people looking for jobs now, because not only have other small businesses been hiring them, a lot of the former jobless may have started their own business as well.</p>
<p>And so they need to make their job opening more attractive.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>lmao how exactly are they going to sell their skills directly to a customer if their skill is say, building cars, and they don’t own a car factory? or if someone has a job as a telemarketer with a company, how are they gonna just be a freelance telemarketer? this model you’re suggesting here isn’t even applicable to most examples someone could give. unless we assume a level of access to resources which is simply not possible for the average worker, then it just isn’t possible for the vast majority of workers to just quit their job and start a one-person business. would that work for a waiter? a bus driver? a janitor? a factory worker? <br /></p>
<p>the idea that the only thing keeping people from being able to start successful one-person businesses is “bureaucratic bullshit” is utterly absurd, the simple reality of how difficult it is for one person, acting alone, to run a competative business, is the much more significant barrier at play here. <br /></p>
<p>also i can’t help but notice that even in your hypothetical fantasy utopia scenario, where everything works way better than it ever could in real life, this hypothetical solo business owner is working 7 days a week and only gets 4 hours of sleep?</p>
<p>hm.</p>
<p>and notice that you said “without all that bureaucratic bullshit to block them and shut them down, they’ll do it, and <b><i>lots</i></b> of them will be successful.”</p>
<p> lots. </p>
<p>not “all”</p>
<p> or even “most” <br /></p>
<p>just “lots”</p>
<p>well shit, that’s a lot of failed business owners sinking into debt without any sort of safety net to help them! so the math on this that you’re giving is bogus, the hypothetical person who was trying to hire new people to their new business would have a nearly infinite stream of desperate failed business owners willing to work for literal pennies.</p>
<p>a much more likely scenario: <br /></p>
<p>worker quits, tries to start own business. hires workers for mere pennies with no problem. business fails anyways, can’t compete with existing established businesses for customers. worker goes back to work for the company they left, but now deeper in debt because of the money they tried to sink into starting a business. eventually utterly unregulated mergers result in the creation of a single megacorp which no one can compete with, which successfully buys up all land, housing, and resources. they charge everyone exorbitant rent and brutally enforce their own system of law, without even the pretense of democratic oversight.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eh, it’s okay, though even the likeliest scenario is probably much less probable than the complement which is comprised out of all other scenarios. So both authors suffers the same problem here.</p>
<p>The thing with small businesses is that you don’t have to get funding via debt that have a lien on your personal asset anyways. And from a leftist I like how they ignore that workers can and do own equity of the megacorp they work for, unions can work even without pro-union laws, and regular people can also pool capital on their own from family, friends and capitalists.</p>
<p>The criticism that many workers have skills that they cannot directly market to consumers is true. But people can retrain themselves of skills that can be easily sold directly to consumers with effort and time, and this is even more significant for new workers that are coming in to the market.</p>
<p>There’s gonna be lots of people who get left behind for sure, and get forced to labor for pennies, though being left behind is only from a relative perspective. And in the first place it’s hard to reason with a narrow enough error margin how many people will be ”successful” even if we define a solid quantitative measure to use.</p>
<p>Investors also currently shuns conglomerates too, and there’s reasons to believe it’s not just anti-trust laws that’s responsible for it. Investors prefers company with market power <b>and</b> competitive advantages in specific segments and even geographical regions. There are reasons to buy competitors to diversify and reduce tail risk since a CEO or executive will messes up eventually.</p>
<p>So I have offered a plausible narrative closer to the libertarians, but monopoly powers are real as well, so that will skew our expectation for the predicted averaged out outcome towards the one offered by leviathan especially in the short-run when people’s adjusting, but it’s not clear that the “averaged” outcome is even very possible.</p>
<p>And it’s also possible that for all major possible policy direct we take, everything is going to look horrible for us in the long run vast majority of the time and the difference between the horrible outcomes might be small or we just can’t decide which one is better.</p>

<p>I mean, there are a number of developed nations that don’t have a minimum wage (Italy, Switzerland, and surprisingly the Nordic countries, and a few others)    </p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_by_country</a><br /></p><p>We can tell what happens from those countries &ndash; and no &mdash; the wage rate did not drop to zero for low wage workers. Now, we can argue that there are reasons for a non-zero minimum wage (price setting power, anti-poverty effects, etc), but a lot of the people responding to that meme are being absurd. </p>
