<p>So if the Democrats take the Senate, Bernie Sanders becomes head of the Senate Budget Committee? Which would make him <i>the fourth most powerful individual in the United States</i>.<br /></p>
<p>Imagine how much we could get done with a Sanders-led Senate Budget Committee under a Democratic president who has already been forced to adopt most of his domestic policy in exchange for his endorsement.</p>
<p>If you really want to see the change we got behind Bernie for, get Clinton into the White House, and get Democrats into the House and Senate.</p>
<p>(Also keep in mind that this next president gets to decide what’s constitutional and unconstitutional for the next 30-50 years, as they will most likely get to appoint at least four Supreme Court Justices.)<br /></p>

<p>Boo! The law needs to be able to apply to those in power, and if you just ‘decide’ what’s constitutional or not, you’re breaking those safeguards. It may help your goals in the short term, but the eroding of the legitimacy of law will in the long run hurt the vulnerable people you’re trying to empower.</p>
