<p>Because why not. Evolution builds things that works; quantum-computation works.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of things where I am calling bullshit:</p>
<p><b>1) Consciousness is super special quantum effects.</b></p>
<p>I see a lot of people willing to talk grandiosely about brains and consciousness, when on the topic of the quantum-nature of the brain. And I’m like: have you considered applying the Yudkowskian philosophical quandary solution?</p>
<p><i>Why do people argue about topic X?</i></p>
<p>“Is consciousness special?” “Is consciousness quantum?” “What is consciousness?”<br /></p>
<p>All reduce to “what makes people feel conscious, and subsequently talk about it?”</p>
<p>My take on it? ‘Consciousness’ is a sensory modality. It probably sits in the insular cortex or something. There was a dude in the late 1800′s(?) who got an aneurysm or something, and shortly thereafter concluded he had no soul. That sounds like someone not feeling consciousness b/c brain damage to me.</p>
<p>You’re two brains connected by a thin neuron bridge, and only one of them can talk. Stop pretending information gleaned from introspective brain functions <i>mean</i> anything.</p>
<p><b>2) Free will is super special quantum effects.</b></p>
<p>See 1).</p>
<p><b>3) The brain’s information is unclonable, and upload tech is doomed to fail.</b></p>
<p>Brains are robust, and the self is an illusion. When you can give a concrete estimate of how much of the self is a persistent uncloneable quantum state (as opposed to a quantum state that naturally arises and self-stabilizes within our neurological pathways, should it be disrupted by… say, a lightning strike, or general anesthesia) I will listen.</p>
<p>Until then, 90% me is still pretty much me.</p>
<p>As for simulating qunatum brains — quantum computers would work.</p>
<p><b>4) The quantum states are really fragile!</b></p>
<p>Biology is a robust, redundant mess in all respects, and brains operate at scalding (comparatively) temperatures, are shock resistant, electromagnetically resistant, and capable of functioning after massive trauma.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of 4 I’m hard pressed to even accept that there is a substantial probability that the computation conducted in the brain is quantum. Engineers have a massive difficulty stabilizing quantum entanglement for quantum computing, even in ideal conditions. I have a hard time seeing how a biological system could pull that off.</p>
