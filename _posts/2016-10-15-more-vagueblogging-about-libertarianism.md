<p><b>Me:</b> What happens if someone wants to join the rape and murder is legal private defense agency?</p>
<p><b>Ancap:</b> The other defense agencies wouldn’t respect that and arrest the people who rape and murder. People wouldn’t associate with people who don’t join one of the non-shitty defense agencies.</p>
<p><b>Me:</b> What happens if two agencies have a dispute about something where both sides have merit.</p>
<p><b>Ancap:</b> There would be an arbitration court that would break the tie.</p>
<p><b>Tl dr.</b> Ancaps aren’t really proposing “anarchy” so much as federalism. A strange type of federalism where the social groups you are part of matter as much as geographic location in deciding what laws you are under, but still federalism.</p>

<p>I had this realization a while ago, that anarcho-capitalism is really a type of “government”, and it actually made it sound much more appealing to me than “anarchy”.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend this essay, “The Advantage of Capitalist Trucks”, to everyone.</p>
<p>Actually, it has a very misleading title. It’s not about trucks at all.</p>
<p>It’s a response to the common objection to anarcho-capitalism, phrased something like <a href="https://tmblr.co/mr_VjRMdGrF-gPcvkpyuSDQ">@slatestarscratchpad</a> puts it <a href="http://raikoth.net/libertarian.html#externalities">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>1.2: But aren’t there are libertarian ways to solve externalities that don’t involve the use of force?</b></p>
<p>To some degree, yes. You can, for example, refuse to move into any neighborhood unless everyone in town has signed a contract agreeing not to raise wasps on their property.</p>
<p>But getting every single person in a town of thousands of people to sign a contract every time you think of something else you want banned might be a little difficult. More likely, you would want everyone in town to unanimously agree to a contract saying that certain things, which could be decided by some procedure requiring less than unanimity, could be banned from the neighborhood - sort of like the existing concept of neighborhood associations.</p>
<p>But convincing every single person in a town of thousands to join the neighborhood association would be near impossible, and all it would take would be a single holdout who starts raising wasps and all your work is useless. Better, perhaps, to start a new town on your own land with a pre-existing agreement that before you’re allowed to move in you must belong to the association and follow its rules. You could even collect dues from the members of this agreement to help pay for the people you’d need to enforce it.</p>
<p>But in this case, you’re not coming up with a clever libertarian way around government, you’re just reinventing the concept of government. <b>There’s no difference between a town where to live there you have to agree to follow certain terms decided by association members following some procedure, pay dues, and suffer the consequences if you break the rules - and a regular town with a regular civic government.</b></p>
<p>As far as I know there is no loophole-free way to protect a community against externalities besides government and things that are functionally identical to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Friedman’s response is to say, sure, there’s no difference between a private civic association where to live there you have to follow the rules, and a government. And there’s no difference between a truck made in America and a truck made in the Soviet Union. No one cares about the “ideology” of a truck: they only care about how well it does performing the job of a truck.</p>
<p>But, of course, there <i>is</i> a difference between “capitalist trucks” and “socialist trucks”. Capitalist trucks were produced under a system where people face strong incentives to produce good quality trucks. Socialist trucks were produced under a system where the incentives were essentially orthogonal to the quality of the trucks.</p>
<p>And it’s the same way, he argues, for governments. A private “government”, such as a condominium association, has market incentives for producing <i>good institutional design</i>, so that it makes rules attracting people to live there. A public government imposed by force faces much weaker incentives, which get increasingly weak the larger the area it controls.</p>
<p>There are some hesitations I have about some aspects of anarcho-capitalism, but I think it’s a very good essay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definitely does make a good point. And probably this is a lot of the reason that capitalism works  &ndash; something along the lines of a corporation or a private business operating the market is a structure with definitely better incentives than the state for at least a lot of issues. And the better arguments for libertarianism/ancap are along those lines. </p><p>My post was more aimed at the  people who didn’t really get that they were, at some point,  choosing between different structures for governance. I wasn’t really aiming this at the sophisticated libertarian viewpoints of David Friedman and such. </p>
