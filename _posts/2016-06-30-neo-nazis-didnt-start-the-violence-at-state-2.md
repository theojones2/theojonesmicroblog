<blockquote>
<p>Antifa started the violence. I actually guessed that after listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/EyrwB1xYups?t=37">this woman</a>: her manner is very defensive and self-justificatory.</p>
<p>Why I am not surprised? It’s obviously in the tactical interests of the “Traditionalist Worker Party” not to be violent, or at least, not to be the first to be violent, and I think these far-right groups have known that for awhile. What’s changed is that a much larger portion of the Left has abandoned the idea of civil society or of common rules in which politics and society should take place.</p>
<p>I mean, I’m against white nationalism, but ultimately I’m against violence (besides legitimate state violence according to law, because fuck anarchism). I don’t want white nationalists empowered, but ultimately more than that, I don’t want <i>anyone</i> empowered who meets political beliefs with violence, because that <i>always ends badly</i>, no matter who it is.<br /></p>
<p>Melissa Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_vgu4ewxVc">“needing some muscle”</a> to push a sympathetic journalist out of U.Missouri park space is another example. The campus is public (or university) space, other people had a right to be there, people don’t have the right to physically push them. Supposedly, we all understand these ground rules, and break them only deliberately. But the “muscle” wasn’t a deliberate act of civil disobedience, rather, <i>it hadn’t even occurred to her</i> or the activists that anyone else’s rights were more important that their protest. Unsurprisingly it eventually ended badly for her…</p>
<p>Back in the day protesters would <i>ridicule</i> the far right rather than attack and thereby justify them. It always seemed much more effective.</p>
