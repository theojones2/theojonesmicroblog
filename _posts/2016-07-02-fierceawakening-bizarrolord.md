<p>Tumblr!Feminism/SJ and fundamentalist religious sects have precisely one thing in common:</p>
<p>A very high standard of ideological and moral “purity” that no mere mortal can even think about achieving, and yet these movements judge their members for failing to meet the unattainable ideal in their everyday lives. </p>
<p>So consider the reason that these groups are so prone to witch-hunt style behavior: by tearing down another person for not being perfect, there is momentarily less pressure on the person doing the persecuting to reach the unattainable standard of perfection and purity.  It’s essentially a deflection tactic so that the people doing the bullying of the “less ideologically pure” are above suspicion for being fallible human beings- for the moment.</p>

<p>i think they have more things in common than precisely one but very yes</p>
