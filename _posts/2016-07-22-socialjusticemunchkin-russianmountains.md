<p>I’ve… Never really thought about how retarded this is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Retarded is barely scratching the surface. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Want to know what real fucking retarded is?<br /><br />Years ago, I got taken to court because this girl I slept with got pregnant, and she didn’t know if it was mine, her bf’s, or the black guy she was screwing as well.<br /><br />So I get put through the test procedures, swabbing and such; lo and behold, it ain’t my kid. It was the black fella<br /><br />But her parents (being upper-class) didn’t like the fact that their grandchild was fathered by an unemployed person (both the black guy and her bf were on unemployment), while I was working as a chef. So, they told their lawyer to motion the court to assign child support payments to me, and he did. <br /><br />And I thought the judge, after hearing such bullshit, would immediately chuck the case out. But I was wrong. She told me seeing as I was already probably preparing myself to be a parent, I should just shoulder the burden and accept it. “From what I can see, you’d be the best choice as father” I was told.<br /><br />I had to literally deny all out paying anything and threaten to go to the media just to get a new judge. And what happened when the new judge saw the summary, and heard the lawyer say “It’s pretty simple your honor. Mr Scarecrow is the best chance this child has for a father, and should pay child support”?<br /><br />“Are you mentally challenged?” she asked the lawyer.<br /><br />It was thrown out and the family was fined for making me miss work.</p>

<p>Jesus fucking wept, this is our legal system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, technically that’s Australia’s legal system. But that very well could happen in the US (and probably has). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consent to sex doesn’t even matter in some cases.</p>
<p>Rape victims have been ordered to pay their rapists.</p>
<p>Specifically statutory rape victims who were minors at the time they were victimized.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/</a><br /><br />There are cases where it even goes to trial and the individual is named the victim of the sexual assault… <b><i>and their rapist is still awarded child support.</i></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>in france (if I’m not mistaken ) DNA paternity tests don’t even matter, if a woman tells the court that she doesn’t want one had hen any form of it is thrown out the window and he gets fisted by the legal system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah man<br />In france, DNA tests are illegal evidence.<br />They can sue you 600,000 € for presenting it.<br />It happened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the fuck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is… wow.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Axiom 1:</b> If you want children to be taken care of, pay for it from taxes. If you don’t want to pay for it from your taxes, other people’s children are obviously not worth being supported against your will. Thus, why the fuck are you trying to force others to something you would’t be willing to face yourself. On the other hand if you are willing to support children from taxes, we don’t need a separate construct of child support complicating things.</p>
<p><b>Axiom 2:</b> Do you want me to show the utility calculations of being forced to pay child support? Because there’s a reasonably good argument that being forced to pay child support is definitely in the same category of burdensomeness as an unwanted pregnancy and if being forced to take an unwanted pregnancy to term as a possible consequence of having sex is unfair, so is non-consensual child support. And the answer is, yes, those both are extremely unfair consequences.</p>
<p>This is why I seriously lobby for paper abortions ~everywhere because it should be bloody obvious that one’s gender, or anatomy, or whatever the fuck, shouldn’t determine the harshness of consequences having sex exposes them to. We already settled a long time ago that such a thing is called “sexism” and it is bad and should be abolished.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Axiom 1 makes no sense. It’s like saying that because I think people should have to pay their debts if possible, I have a responsibility to do it myself and should be taxed to that end.</p>
<p>And if it’s so unfair to expect parents to shoulder the financial burden of their children, how is it more fair to demand the same of uninvolved bystanders?<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should you be forced to pay the debt of someone else, when you never consented to the debt in the first place? That’s my entire point; the child support laws which don’t give people input to whether they consent to child support and instead just assume it from the fact that sex happened (or in the more horrifying cases, from being raped or from some contrived chain of events) are about as fair as you being held responsible for the debts someone else racked up just because you lent them a fiver when they were in need. Yes, ~*~technically~*~ you could argue that by giving them a fiver you demonstrated consent to paying for their shit (and arbitrarily huge amounts of it even), but that explanation won’t hold in any reasonable place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the other issue with the debt response is that the exact topic of the discussion is about whether the government should recognize child support requests of a certain type as valid debts.  Saying that they are debts under the current system is pretty much a red herring argument.  Because the fact that <i>they are debts</i> is irrelevant to whether they <i>should be debts</i>. </p>
