<p><b>Me:</b> What happens if someone wants to join the rape and murder is legal private defense agency?</p><p><b>Ancap:</b> The other defense agencies wouldn&rsquo;t respect that and arrest the people who rape and murder. People wouldn&rsquo;t associate with people who don&rsquo;t join one of the non-shitty defense agencies.</p><p><b>Me:</b> What happens if two agencies have a dispute about something where both sides have merit.</p><p><b>Ancap:</b> There would be an arbitration court that would break the tie.</p><p><b>Tl dr.</b> Ancaps aren&rsquo;t really proposing &ldquo;anarchy&rdquo; so much as federalism. A strange type of federalism where the social groups you are part of matter as much as geographic location in deciding what laws you are under, but still federalism.</p>
