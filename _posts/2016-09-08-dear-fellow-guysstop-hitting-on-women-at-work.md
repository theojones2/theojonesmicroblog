<p>So i work as your friendly underpaid barista and currently we’re having problems with one of our regulars hitting on our women staff members. The first woman he hit one, he wrote a note to her….as in elementary school note passing. Now of course, she’s at work and the model in f&amp;b and retail is that you do everything in your power not to piss off the guest. <br /><br />So in hopes of not causing a scene, she kindly wrote on the note that she appreciate the interest but she’s a lesbian. Now, 1) she shouldn’t have to out herself to a complete stranger all to avoid a bad yelp review. 2) She shouldn’t be forced into a situation where she has to entertain a guests unwanted attentions to avoid at the least, a negative review on yelp. <br /><br />So once she passes this dude the note, he then starts jokingly exclaiming “I always fall for lesbians” in the middle of our cozy cafe, effectively outing her to anyone within earshot. Now my co-worker isn’t closeted, she’s out and proud etc, etc. However, that doesn’t give someone else the right to disclose her sexuality without her permission, and especially not after he effectively coerced her into outing herself in order to avoid his come-ons.  <br /><br />Another one of our regular guests, hits on one of our baristas on a regular basis. No matter how much she casually brings up her boyfriend. It’s gotten so bad that I’ve had to literally stand in front of her so he can’t force eye-contact with her (Naturally we do this kind of thing in a low-key manner so that we don’t actively piss off guest and thus put our jobs at risk).<br /><br />I’ve had to actively shut down people on behalf of my women co-workers (Nah dude, she’s seeing someone. She’s not interested in that sort of thing. Dude, chill out.) because they simply can’t understand the fact that they are at their jobs and simply just want to get their jobs done and go home. Stop taking advantage of the unequal power dynamics to force her to engage you. She’s seem nice? Of course she is, her job revolves around being nice. She seemed into you? No, I can promise she’s not, she’s doing her job and told me five minutes ago how you were clearly staring down her chest. <br /><br />“But how am I supposed to let her no I’m interested in her?” you might say. My answer, that’s not my fucking concern. There are plenty of opportunities to meet people in this world that don’t revolve around you forcing them into an uncomfortable position while they’re literally trying to earn a living. Not every person your interested in obligated to entertain that interest. <br /><br />Simply put, stop being goddam creepers and let people do their goddamn jobs. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fuck off. Some of us have a hard enough time talking to people without shitheads like you guilting us over it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one’s guilting you over anything. The point of this post is for you to stop doing it, not to do it and feel guilty.<br /><br />If you feel awkward hitting on someone who’s not in a position where she can safely be honest with you or leave if you make her uncomfortable, that’s good. Listen to that awkward feeling. It’s telling you that you’re transgressing a boundary.<br /><br />Now, if you feel like you’re always awkward and always crossing a boundary, then posts like this should be a gold mine. It’s telling you in clear terms where boundaries actually exist and why. </p>

<p>Story time:</p>

<p>There was this dude I knew through a monthly infosec meeting. He knew me and my fiancee and my friends through this meeting and he started coming to the coffee shop while I was working. He took a shine to one of my coworkers. He started asking me when she would be on shift and when I wouldn’t tell him he started showing up every night just in case. So she took on afternoon shifts and he started showing up in the afternoons. So she took morning shifts and he started showing up in the morning. So she started taking random shifts and he started showing up all day, from four thirty am when we opened until close at one am. <br /></p>

<p>The thing is, while this is creepy in hindsight he wasn’t doing anything overtly creepy. The shop billed itself as “Smalltown’s Living Room” and there were a few regulars who hung out all day. And this guy bought endless iced teas and ate all his meals off our menu and bought ice cream for regulars and tipped extravagantly. He must have been spending close to a hundred dollars a day at the shop and never did anything beyond placing his order, chatting for a minute, and sitting in a chair where he could always watch the counter. Sometimes he’d talk to me after I locked up and asked if she liked him and ask me how he could get him to like her and no amount of “dude, it’s not going to happen, she’s not interested” could convince him. “But she’s so nice to me,” he’d say, “she smiles when she sees me and listens when I talk to her. No other girls do that for me.”</p>

<p>The owner felt a little hogtied by the whole thing - the guy hadn’t DONE anything, except spend more money than my coworkers and I made on a shift each day to have the opportunity to see her. At least five hundred a week on product. Almost the payroll of a full-time employee every week. And there was always a ten or a twenty from him in the tip jar at the end of every shift - five or ten dollars that represented about an extra hour’s worth of labor to everyone working there. So my co-worker and I felt bad too - he wasn’t really being THAT creepy, was it worth it to deprive our other co-workers of this extra income? (Spoilers: yes)</p>

<p>After a couple months of this (and yes, it was terrible that it went on for that long) my coworker got a better-paying, stalker-free job at her university and nobody was happier for her than me. It was my stupid bullshit that had infected her life and if I hadn’t told this acquaintance to swing by the coffee shop sometime she wouldn’t have had to deal with being scared and tense and having to hold a brittle smile every day at work just so that five or ten would reliably show up, so that someone’s hours wouldn’t get cut because of the dip in sales.</p>

<p>And when she left this guy was crushed. Didn’t show up for a month. Then he started coming in again. Started talking to me about how heartbroken he was, hanging out for my entire shift and thanking me for being such a good listener and marveling over the fact that my fiancee, his friend didn’t appreciate me the way I deserved. He’d follow me out on my lunch break and sit at my table. Eventually I went to the Smalltown Police Department and asked what I would need for a restraining order.</p>

<p>“Well, have you told him in clear words that he is not to speak to you and to leave you alone?”</p>

<p>“I can’t, he’s a customer and he only speaks to me in front of other customers.”</p>

<p>“Well, unless you tell him to cut off contact and he violates that there’s nothing we can do.”</p>

<p>And that was the real nastiness of this trick - always being in front of other customers. When you’re on register you can’t tell a customer never to speak to you again then casually move on to the next person in line. When you’re getting a muffin out of the pastry case you can’t tell a customer “go away and never come back” in front of some soccer mom who believes the customer is always right. You can drown someone out with a blender or an espresso machine, but only temporarily. There was a cubbyhole where we put our purses under the register - eventually it got to the point that if I saw him through the windows I’d let my coworker know then crawl into it to hide. Sometimes I’d spend half a shift doing dishes and making sandwiches in the back where he couldn’t follow me. At least we’d never run out of clean mugs, right?</p>

<p>It was too much. I told my fiancee and a couple other infosec friends what he was doing. He’d stopped coming to the meetings months before over a tiff with another dude so they weren’t seeing him. The had jobs to go to, they didn’t have the time to sit at a coffee shop with me all day. So they took a day off work in the middle of the week and when this guy followed me outside on my lunchbreak I texted them that he was there with me. I didn’t respond to anything that he said during that lunch, I only said “I don’t want to talk to you anymore, please leave me alone.” I said it quietly, but I said it in clear words, per what the police department had told me. He continued to talk while I continued to look at my book and try to eat my food when my fiancee and his friend showed up and joined us at the table. My fiancee (who is, by the way, over six and a half feet tall and built like a fridge) sat down next to him, our other friend sat down on the other side. They both very casually asked what he’d been up to recently. He didn’t say anything, just bit his lip, glared at me, and stormed off. He never came back to the coffee shop.</p>

<p>He DID email a friend of mine to rage about how I’d broken his heart and lied to him and misled him and sent mixed signals - how it was so nasty and two-faced to be smiling and nice one minute and turn on him the next, how he thought we had a connection, and why would I spend so much time listening to him and laughing at his jokes and smiling at him otherwise?</p>

<p>For two months nothing happened, then he showed up at the infosec meeting and as my fiancee and I were getting into the car to leave he charged at us and started trying to hit my (once again, goddamned enormous) fiancee and trying to push past him to come at me. This guy was about five ten and not terribly strong, and while we were scared we didn’t want to fucking KILL him, so my fiancee just sort of knocked him down instead of having a serious fight. The guy got into his car, rushed around  bunch of us in the parking lot, which was genuinely terrifying because we thought he might try to run someone over, then sped away into the night. We called the cops to file a report of assault. The cops didn’t want to talk to me, said I wasn’t involved in the altercation. They took a statement from my fiancee and two other guys who had been in the parking lot, then took down my number and a note that I claimed he’d been “close” to me. I told them he’d been harassing me but they just said that it wasn’t harassment if he just showed up at my job and didn’t actually DO anything.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that while we were making our report this guy had driven to our friend’s house and rammed the house repeatedly with his Honda. He completely caved in the garage and tried to charge the living room but was stopped by a reinforced concrete wall. When the cops showed up there he was on the lawn raging about how we were all against him and trying to control him.</p>

<p>I missed all my classes the next day because I went to my college campus police department and said I needed a restraining order. I explained what had happened and their first question was how long I had dated the guy. Why did he think we were dating if I hadn’t been flirting with him? Had I led him on or tried to make it seem like I was interested in him? They escorted me to the women’s violence prevention center on campus and I spent approximately six hours filling out paperwork before the director of the center drove me to the county courthouse and made sure I was granted a temporary restraining order that day. It was made more difficult because I only knew this guy’s first name. At every step I had to reach out to my infosec friends or my fiancee to ask for his address, to check the spelling of his name, to confirm the make and model of his vehicle. This guy had chased my coworker out of a job, been showing up on every one of my shifts for months, and I didn’t know anything about him because to me he was just a customer who was an annoyance that had become a threat. But in his head I was the nice girl he’d had a meet-cute with at a fucking hacker hangout who blossomed into a romance in the goddamned coffee-shop AU he was scripting in his imagination, who spurned this rich, considerate, shy boy in favor of her lunk of a boyfriend who wasn’t good enough for her. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to explain a fifteen-year-old gray-hat hacker meetup to a judge in a way that doesn’t make it sound like you’re selling heroin? Calling it a professional infosec networking group didn’t work well enough to include it on the list of places on my restraining order. He couldn’t come to my coffee shop, my home, or my school but was free to return to the meeting where he’d attacked us that was full of my friends who DIDN’T have restraining orders so long as he left when I showed up.</p>

<p>I hate coffee-shop AUs, in case that isn’t clear. It perpetuates this idea that the person behind the counter is your ONE if only you’re persistent and sweet and generous and bashful enough to keep forcing them to endure your presence in their place of employment.<br /></p>

<p>Look, it sounds fucking shitty to say it but most customer service jobs can be accomplished by machines. Automated phone trees can take the place of receptionists, you can get a latte as good as anything you’d get from a Starbucks out of a machine, cashiers can be replaced by self-checkout. Even bartenders can be replaced by some tubes and buttons if you have enough money to burn. <i><b>The reason customer service still exists is because it is emotional labor that the customer is paying for.</b></i> An automated phone tree can’t reassure you that it’ll pass your message along just as soon as possible and that we’ll make sure the tech gets back to you. An automated espresso machine won’t smile at you and ask if you’re having a good day. A self-checkout doesn’t make small talk about how great that ice-cream is or how nice the day is outside. A drink machine may be able to listen to your problems but it won’t say “I feel you,” and tell a funny story to make you feel better. We live in the fucking future, almost everything you could want can be accomplished with an machine an a cellphone. If you’re interacting with a human it’s because you want to interact with a human and you want that human to be nice to you. You are paying for their kindness, for their smiles when their feet hurt and their questions about your day when they haven’t had lunch yet.</p>

<p>Flirting with customer service workers at work, asking them out when they’re on the clock and paid to make you happy, telling them you think they’re attractive and expecting a gushing response - that’s breaking the rules. That’s a lose-lose situation that you’ve set them up for. If they continue to do their job and be nice to you they’re “leading you on” and if they react negatively and ask you to leave or to not speak to them that way it’s “bad customer service.”</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb if you’re thinking about asking someone out or flirting with them is to ask yourself this question: “if do this thing and it makes them uncomfortable can they leave this place without it impacting their livelihood?”</p>

<p>If the answer is “no” and you do it anyway you’re a jackass. That person is trapped. You have cornered them. You have put your desire to flirt with them over their ability to earn a living.</p>

<p>“Oh good, I’ll do it now, when they can’t get away” is not an effective dating strategy. It’s abusive, it’s creepy, and nobody is well-paid enough to put up with unwanted sexual or romantic advances while they’re trying to do their job. <br /></p>

<p>Don’t pull this shit.<br /></p>

<p>ALL OF THIS. </p>
<p>I used to work in retail years and years back, then I moved on to clerical work in public sector organisations that involves some, at least, meeting and dealing directly with the public.</p>
<p>By the way, I hate the use of cutesy-poo terms forced on us like “guests” and “clients”.  You’re not, you’re customers and we’re employees and our livelihoods depend on keeping you happy.</p>
<p>FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO NEVER WORKED IN A SERVICE INDUSTRY* JOB AND DON’T GET IT:</p>
<p>We <i><b>have</b></i> to be nice to you.  It’s a requirement of the job.  It’s part of the duties of our employment.  Most of us are normal human beings who like being pleasant and courteous to others anyway, but it doesn’t matter if we have the natural personality of Oscar the Grouch: we compulsorily <b>have </b>to be smiling and nice and chatty and helpful and all the rest of it. </p>
<p>Normally, when there are the same regulars showing up, we can’t help but know a little bit about them.  That’s why you do have the “Hi Mrs Jones, how’s your Bert’s lumbago?” interactions - not alone because, as I said, most of us are normal human beings who socially interact with others, but because it’s part of the job requirement to “personalise” service and add that special touch, go the extra mile, keep the customer happy by little things like “I remember your regular order/you might like to try this because you like that other thing/hey you’re [Name] and you mentioned [Thing] and I remember, because this isn’t simply a commercial transaction, it’s a relationship!”</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: IT <b>IS</b> A COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION, IT’S <b>NOT</b> A RELATIONSHIP.  IGNORE THE ADVERTISING AND PR BULLSHIT.  THIS IS A STORE OR OTHER BUSINESS, NOT YOUR LIVING ROOM OR ‘WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME’.  WE ARE NOT YOUR BEST BUDDIES, WE’RE WORKERS DOING THIS FOR A LIVING.</p>
<p>Other customers only see the interaction between what looks like an ordinary customer and the worker; if the worker is deemed unpleasant (as in the example of why ms-demeanour couldn’t tell her stalker to leave her alone) by the customer who has no idea what’s really going on, they are probably going to vote with their feet and not visit that shop anymore</p>
<p>Bosses doesn’t like this.  Why is “the customer is always right”?  Because the customer <i>gives </i>them money and we <i>cost</i> them money.  Customers keep them in business.  They can’t afford to and don’t want to lose customers.  That’s why, if a customer complains of unfriendly, unhelpful or rude staff, management are more likely to take the customer’s side than that of staff, and give us a chewing-out or even let us go.</p>
<p>Why is hitting on or trying to ask out someone at work a bad idea?</p>
<p>

Because you, as the customer, have a certain degree of power.  We’re <i>not </i>meeting as equals, it’s <i>not</i> our free time it’s our place of work, we <i>don’t </i>have much if any choice in how we interact with you.  You’re spending a considerable amount of money every week as in the first example?  If we discourage you and send you away, we’re costing the store money.  Even a reasonable boss might fire us, and there are plenty who aren’t reasonable, who would say “Be nice to the guy, he’s our best customer, or you can leave and look for work elsewhere”.  We don’t get to tell you “no” the same way we’d get to tell you “no” if we met on free time elsewhere.  We can’t even treat you coldly and hope you get the hint; we have to smile and be nice.  And then you think we’re interested, and then you think we’re leading you on if we finally make you understand we’re not interested.</p>
<p>And then you complain to our manager or go online and leave bad reviews and write social media posts about the bitch of a waitress or barista or shop assistant who played you for a sucker, and nobody knows the real story of how you were a harasser.  <br /></p>
<p>It happened to me: the busiest day of the week, a queue of customers waiting to be served, and when at the end of the shift I got chewed out by the manager.</p>
<p>Because a customer complained I didn’t have a chat with her.  While there were people queued up waiting to be served, only wanting to get their stuff and get home.  I wasn’t rude, I’d smiled and exchanged greetings and been efficient and polite, but I hadn’t stopped to have a conversation because it was too damn busy and I didn’t feel like it.</p>
<p>And she complained to the store manager, and the store manager rebuked me for it.  And if I’d spent time chatting with her, the other customers waiting in line would (rightly) have been pissed-off, and would have complained, and I’d have been told by my manager not to waste time - “you’re not employed here to have a chat, do that on your own time!”</p>
<p>Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.</p>
<p>*I count public sector/government employee work here as well, anything where you’re the interface between the public and the organisation.  You can (and I’ve seen it at work) have members of the public yelling abuse at you or being physically violent (one guy actually broke a door) and you have to stay calm, stay pleasant, and can’t tell them fuck off.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>to put it in terms some people will understand better, when you’re at work you’re not allowed to break character, and that character is totally people-pleasing and never-say-no and customer-is-always-right by design. if employees break character, even for their own safety, they get fired. like, people get fired for taking unauthorized bathroom breaks, and they’re not allowed to sit when standing for eight hours literally does damage. do you really think people can say no, no matter how much they want to?</p>
<p>and then people go off and bitch about how “women play games and send mixed messages”. </p>
<p>customers hitting on workers is the same as a boss hitting on an employee–that’s illegal for obvious reasons, because they can’t say no. acting like you’re being cute doesn’t change the fact you know what you’re doing and how you’re taking advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is altogether too sad. And horrifying - you never know who will be crazy and destructive/murderous. </p>
<p>(I wonder what policy type stuff could be done - it seems like one could have exerted some kind of boundary earlier on, if the boss was neither stupid nor evil. We do not live in that world. OTOH, crashing a car into a house… Will not likely stop this side of a naked sword. Maybe if we had a sorta service-ticket-ish system for reviews, the pressure of BS bad reviews could be lifted?)</p>
<p>(“Feeling awkward? You must be crossing a boundary” is a TERRIBLE heuristic though. For me 8 years ago, that would include things like “existing in a girl’s general direction” and 4 years ago would still preclude even the most benign expression of interest, to anyone, anywhere. My proposal is more “you can talk to people, as long as you LEAVE, you will eventually learn how to socialize and as long as you always LEAVE ALREADY, SERIOUSLY the damage you will do is very limited.)</p>
<p><br />(I have now an uncomfortable sense that the only cafés, restaurants, etc to still have human waiters in the future will be either traditionalist backwaters or weird platonic dens of almost-prostitution.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cashier here, and the analysis here is basically correct.</p>
<p>(I do have commentary to add, but this thread is already rather long and it would probably just get buried anyway. For now I’m reblogging this in appreciation of the fact that it’s a good presentation of the standard points without veering much into obnoxious culture war Low Feminism.)<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ultimate rule here is <i>don’t try to hit on people who can’t easily leave/tell you to get lost</i>. A good amount of the cases of creepiness boil down to that point.  </p>
