The LP had two serious goals in this election 1) cross the 5% threshold needed to guarantee ballot access in future elections and election financing, and 2) cross the 15% threshold to gain debate access. Either goal would help move the LP towards being a mainstream party. Based on the 538 predictions it&rsquo;s pretty clear that 1 is going to happen, and 2 isn&rsquo;t. Johnson/Weld are on track to get around 9% of the vote. But given that they aren&rsquo;t going to win the election, they might not actually mind pushing some of their votes towards Hillary, as long as they don&rsquo;t drop below 5%.<br /></p></div>
