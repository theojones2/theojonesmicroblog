<p>I’ve seen a lot of people on social media talk about how Trump might be good in the long run because he could shake things up and force everyone else to make shifts in the toxic environment of U.S politics. Trump could shake up things in U.S politics. He very well could. But I’m not sure the change would be good. Sure, the parties could respond to the near-disaster his campaign is bringing and realize that personal vilification of opponents, hyperpartizanship, and anti-intellectualism are dangerous, even if they provide short-term political benefits. Or they could just respond to Trump by thinking the other side is scum even more and doubling down on the personal vilification of opponents, hyperpartizanship, and anti-intellectualism.</p>
