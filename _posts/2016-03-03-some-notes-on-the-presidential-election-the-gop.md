<p>Some notes on the presidential election</p>
<h2>The GOP Debate</h2>
<p>* Trump bragged about the size of his penis on the debate stage. He is keeping up the crude and vulgar thing pretty well.  And then he made a second “little Marco” joke. Two dick jokes during the evening o_O<br />
<ul>
<li>LOL at the Trump university shouting match.<br /></li>
<li>Cruz “Is this the debate you want on the national stage?”<br /></li>
<li>Kasich is sounding professional, but is for some reason crashing and burning in the actual elections.<br /></li>
<li>Cruz was raging about how “left rats” destroyed Detroit.<br /></li>
<li>Cruz “Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth”<br /></li>
<li>Trump to Cruz: “Liar Ted”<br /></li>
</ul>


Cruz: Breathe. I know it’s hard, but breathe.<br />
Rubio: When you’re done with yoga, can I say something?<br />
<ul>
<li>Rubio: “Donald has not shown a seriousness on the issues of foreign policy”<br /></li>
<li>Trump really doesn’t seem to like his Putin sympathy pointed out.<br /></li>
<li>Rubio: “When will trump ever give a serious answer on foreign policy?” I’m thinking never.<br /></li>
<li>Russia seems to be the only country Trump wants to work with.<br /></li>
<li>LOL at the Kasich anti-Trump ad.<br /></li>
<li>It doesn’t seem like any of the candidates are ‪#‎NeverTrump‬</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A good diagram from fivethirtyeight<br /><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/fox-news-republican-debate-detroit-presidential-election-2016/">“Tonight was a debate on the merits of Trump: questions about his character and his associated scandals made up more than a quarter of all questions asked by the moderators. His signature issue, immigration (six questions), came just behind foreign policy (eight questions).”</a><br /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/libresco-topics-liveblog.png?fit=575%2C306&amp;ssl=1" alt="libresco-topics-liveblog" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25" /></p>

The Republican and Democratic nominations are theirs to lose”</a></p>
<p>Stormfront loves Trump. So do chan trolls, #GamerGate supporters and NRx types. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-republican-race-white-power-1.3290776">“Trump gets thumbs-up from neo-Nazis, white nationalists”</a>    <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/news/239143/donald-trump-embraces-his-4chan-fans/">“Donald Trump Embraces His 4Chan Fans”</a></p>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hillary-clintons-got-this/">“Something truly crazy would have to happen for Bernie Sanders to win the Democratic nomination.”</a></p>
<p>Krugman on Sanders<a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/wonkery-has-a-well-known-liberal-bias/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog%20Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body">“But what if the political left starts behaving like the political right, making support for implausible claims a litmus test of loyalty, declaring that anyone raising hard questions is ipso facto corrupt? That would become very uncomfortable, to say the least…….So I hope that the Sanders campaign doesn’t just brush off this criticism as the “establishment” doing its corrupt thing, and realizes that it really is in danger of losing not just an election but an important part of what it should be standing for.”</a></p>

<p>Scott Summer on Trump</p>
<p><a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=31516">“Here’s what I don’t get. People can clearly see what other people are like, when they are average people. But when they are celebrities, it seems like people are unable to perceive even the most obvious character traits. I recently banned my first commenter in 7 years, a crude and obnoxious guy named ‘Shmebulock, Crusher of Pussy’. Almost all my other commenters, even Trump supporters, were glad to get rid of him. So why can’t they see that Trump: Crusher of Pussy, is also a juvenile troll? “</a></p>
