<p>“Many commentators have observed that the radicalisms of the right and left feed on one another… excessive left-wing speech policing and cultural brinksmanship on issues of race and gender was bound to make Milo-style ideological transgression more appealing… the alt-right’s newfound cultural power seems to vindicate some of the assumptions of the PC left: that racism and misogyny are deeply embedded in America’s cultural fabric, just below the surface, ready to erupt unless controls on thought and language are continuously tightened.</p>

<p>But what if instead of thinking of the campus left and the alt-right as mortal enemies, each bringing out perpetually heavier firepower in a long-running war of attrition, we thought of them as allies in a battle for the fate of liberalism? Because despite what they might say about each other, the radicalisms of 2016 actually align with one another more than they align with the Anglo-American Enlightenment tradition that has always occupied the American political center.”</p>

<p>“The campus left has been arguing for years that the United States Constitution, the Western canon, and other “dead white male” materials are shot through with misogyny and white supremacy… The approach of the alt-right is to effectively concede the issue to the campus leftists, and then some: “Yes, you’re right, our political and cultural institutions were not built to accommodate people like you.””</p>

<p>“The PC left and the alt-right exist symbiotically with one another: Working together to exacerbate tribal loyalties, to undermine the legitimacy of the state as a political unit, to question the idea that Western institutions can really treat groups of people with equal respect…”</p>

<p>“neither the alt-right nor the campus left are nationalists in the proper sense: The alt-right sees globalized ethnic groups, rather than states, as the proper unit of solidarity and cohesion. And the far-left considers it bigoted to prioritize the well-being of one’s fellow countrymen over those who live outside of arbitrarily constructed borders.”</p>

<p>I’d actually argue that BOTH the “campus Left” (know as SJW in these parts) AND the Alt-right believe that globalized ethnic groups are the proper unit of solidarity. They just have different favorite globalized ethnic groups.</p>

<p>This article says well something I’ve been thinking about for a while. The article doesn’t go into it, but I’ve also observed harmonious views on interracial relationships: both condemn in-group members who date or marry out of their ethnicity.</p>
