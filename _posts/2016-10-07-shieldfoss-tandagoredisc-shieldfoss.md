<p>The other thing is why on earth would you put your manufacturing directly at the point of sale; presumably luxury communism requires efficiency, and that’s not likely to be efficient at all.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re in Manhattan or Mumbai or wherever and you want to buy a phone. (Sorry, acquire a phone out of your basic necessity allowance or bonus credits for being popular and awesome or whatever).</p>
<p>But before you can get to the phone shop you have to walk through the assembly line, aluminium smelter, oil refinery, and silicon fab that are busily manufacturing the phone you want.</p>
<p>We have transport! We can stick all the boring industrial crap far away from our cities and just ship stuff in! Instructions can be communicated electronically!</p>
<p>I mean there’s also the fact that efficiencies of scale exist, and that we have a way to reward people that do popular things already, but eh.</p>

<p>To bring a completely different thing into this: That is my #1 issue with “agrarian urbanism” and all assorted rot.</p>
<p>You want a roof garden? Or maybe a chicken coop? Buy “local” food? Amazing, you do you, let’s not ban that. You’re allowed to do what you want with your own money.</p>
<p>You want to <i>enforce</i> local food production, and by code keep farmland near to the urban center? Are you <i>mental</i>? “Local” food is the <i>opposite</i> of “good for the environment.” It is an aesthetic, and a poor one at that because it ruins other good things. You will notice that fuel <i>costs money</i> so if it was so inefficient to transport food from far away, distant food would be <i>more</i>, not <i>less</i>, expensive.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if it isn’t just different meanings, but “local” here generally means something that is from the same country (Austria here). So the difference between local tomatoes isn’t if it is from near the city but rather if it is from Austria or from Spain. <br /></p>
<p>The objection that fuel price isn’t high enough to account for it’s externalities is also a common one. <br /></p>

<p>It’s different meanings. Danish consumers are also willing to pay a premium to purchase Danish vegetables instead of foreign. That’s not what the “Local Food” movement is about though.</p>
<p>Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>No single definition of “local” or “local food systems” exists. The geographic distances between production and consumption varies within the movement. However, the general public recognizes that “local” describes the marketing arrangement (e.g. farmers selling directly to consumers at regional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_market" title="Farmers' market">farmers’ markets</a> or to schools).<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_food#cite_note-Martinez-6">[6]</a></sup><br /></p></blockquote>
<p>Going down to the “Criticism” part and focusing on Environmental Impact:</p>
<blockquote><p>

Numerous studies have shown that locally and sustainably grown foods actually release more greenhouse gases than food made in factory farms. The “Land Degradation” section of the United Nations report <i>Livestock’s Long Shadow</i> concludes that “Intensification - in terms of increased productivity both in livestock production and in feed crop agriculture - can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation”.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_food#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> Furthermore, Nathan Pelletier of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia found that cattle raised on open pastures release 50% more greenhouse gas emissions than cattle raised in factory farms.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_food#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> Additionally, Adrian Williams of Cranfield University in England found that free range and organic raised chickens have a 20% greater impact on global warming than chickens raised in factory farm conditions, and organic egg production had a 14% higher impact on the climate than factory farm egg production. Stănescu, Vasille. “Green Eggs and Ham? The Myth of Sustainable Meat, and studies such as Christopher Weber’s report on food miles have shown that the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions in production far outweighs those in transportation: which implies that locally grown food is actually worse for the environment than food made in factory farms.

<p>People - and by “people” I mean the general consumer - can be forgiven for not knowing this. It seems obvious that if a ship transports sweet peas to you in a container from Vietnam, that takes fuel. And if, instead, you purchase sweat peas from a local farmer, that doesn’t take fuel (except for the truck from the farm).</p>
<p>But the actual fact is that ships don’t use fuel. I mean, yes, obviously they <i>do</i> but they use very little fuel compared to what you’d imagine. If e.g. a box of sweet peas are transported to you from Vietnam, the actual production used ten times as much fuel as the truck from the harbor to you, and the truck from the harbor used ten times as much fuel as the ship, per weight of product. Which means that in the formula for environmental impact, the “production” term absolutely <i>dominates</i> the equation to such an extend that you can basically completely ignore where in the world the food was produced.</p>
<p>But people don’t know this - and that’s fair, I don’t expect the average consumer <i>to</i> know this, that’s not your job.</p>
<p>The problem arises when people who <i>should</i> know better - MPs from the Green Party, local farmers and people from environmentalist movements - come out in favor of “eating local.” Local food is one of two things: An aesthetic, or a protectionist practice in favor of local farmers. It is not environmentalism. Buy the cheapest vegetables - that’s the ones that had the lowest fuel costs in bringing them to you.</p>
