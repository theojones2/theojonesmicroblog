<p>Imagine a study of the alcohol industry which interviewed not a 
single brewer, wine expert, liquor store owner or drinker, but instead 
relied solely on the statements of ATF agents, dry-county politicians 
and members of Alcoholics Anonymous and Mothers Against Drunk

 of failed hot dog stand operators as the basis for broad statements 
about every kind of food business from convenience stores to food trucks
 to McDonald’s to five-star restaurants?</p>
