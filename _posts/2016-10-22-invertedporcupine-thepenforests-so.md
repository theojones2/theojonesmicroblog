<p>So: consequentialism.</p>
<p>I find myself pretty much completely on board with consequentialism in an intellectual sense, and in fact most of my intuitions are pretty consequentalist to being with, so I don’t even have to do much in the way of mental gymnastics to maintain a consequentalist position in life.</p>
<p>The one exception to this is certain kinds of dishonesty and deception.</p>
<p>For example: say I have a partner who I’m completely and utterly in love with, and (for whatever reason) I want them to remain faithful to me. And say they cheat on me, but they’re very very good at cheating, and so I go to my grave not knowing that they cheated.</p>
<p>For some reason this really really bothers me, and I’m not entirely sure I can call my reasoning consequentialist.</p>
<p>I mean, okay: at some level, obviously I’m trying to imagine a situation where I don’t know that I’m being cheated on, but to concretely imagine the situation in the first place I of course have to “know” that the cheating is taking place. So I have to both “know” and “not know” that I’m being cheated on in the thought experiment, and that’s probably where some of the weirdness comes in.</p>
<p>But still, <i>argh</i>. It’s like, no, I just don’t want to be cheated on, <i>period</i>. It doesn’t matter whether I know or not, it’s still <i>bad</i>. And this reasoning seems pretty non-consequentialist, at least superficially. I am my brain, and my brain obviously isn’t being affected by things it doesn’t know about. So where, specifically, is the harm in that case? What is the bad consequence, in terms of a sentient being being affected in a way they don’t want to be affected?</p>
<p>You could take a few different routes here. One would be to say that by cheating on someone, even in the case where you know you won’t be found out, you’re making it <i>plausible</i> for a generic person to believe that they will be cheated on, even when they have no direct evidence that they <i>are</i> actually being cheated on. So you’re essentially eroding public trust, which is causing direct material harm to brains that actually exist, because those brains will be less likely to trust their partners who are in fact faithful.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I buy this, though. For one it just seems too vague and nebulous. But more concretely: if I were in some post-apocalyptic scenario where only me and two other people were left alive, and I fell in love with one of those two people, but they cheated on me with the other person, would that suddenly make super-secretive cheating okay? There’s no more public trust left to erode, because there’s no public. But it still seems wrong to me, even if I’m not aware that I’m being cheated on.</p>
<p>The other route you could take would be to say that I just have preferences over the state of the universe, period. And so I could prefer a universe where I’m not cheated on, even if I don’t actually know whether or not I’m being cheated on. This <i>sort of</i> works, I guess, but it still seems a bit non-consequentialist – again, how <i>exactly</i> am I being harmed if I don’t know about the cheating? My brain certainly isn’t affected by it.</p>
<p>The other alternative, of course, would be to just accept that cheating is okay if you’re never found out. I don’t think I want to go down that road, but I can’t rule it out entirely.</p>
<p>So what does everyone else think? Has anyone else struggled with these issues?</p>

<p>Rule consequentialism is probably superior to act consequentialism for reasons like this.</p>

<p>This is probably a good time to note that consequentialism != utilitarianism and that non-utilitarian consquentialisms often don’t have the issues that <a href="https://tmblr.co/mPzi1WlLClXq-yTBEuTN04Q">@thepenforests</a> noted</p><p>See,</p><p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=e3XOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%22a+credible+rule+on+lying+and+the+richard+nixon+problem%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvoduCr-3PAhVoxFQKHVuOCTcQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20credible%20rule%20on%20lying%20and%20the%20richard%20nixon%20problem%22&amp;f=false">https://books.google.com/books?id=e3XOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%22a+credible+rule+on+lying+and+the+richard+nixon+problem%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvoduCr-3PAhVoxFQKHVuOCTcQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20credible%20rule%20on%20lying%20and%20the%20richard%20nixon%20problem%22&amp;f=false</a><br /></p>
