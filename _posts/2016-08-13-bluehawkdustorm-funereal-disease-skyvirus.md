<p>When you “refuse to preface with ‘notall-’ to soothe egos”, please think about whose egos you are actually chafing. </p>
<p>It’s not the arrogant and the toxic, the ones who perhaps deserve to be taken down a peg. It’s the vulnerable, the marginalized, the hurting. It’s <i>people who already hate themselves and do not need that hate from yet another direction</i>. </p>

<p>can someone explain to me what the hell this is saying the only context ive heard this in is for example when women discuss how men oppress them and are told “not all men”. in that example i have zero idea who you think would be the marginalized group – either you think men are marginalized, or you think that women speaking freely about the struggles they face is causing their own oppression. both of which are totally bullshit ideas.</p>
<p>maybe im missing something bc im confused by the vague wording but if this is what i think it is…. uh…. no……………..</p>

<p>What I’m saying is that when people refuse to say “not all men”, they need to remember that some men <i>are</i>, in fact, marginalized. Maybe not for their maleness, but there are plenty of men who have it hard from society at large for their race, their sexuality, their disability, etc. I don’t want to silence women who speak about their own oppression, but we also need to keep intersections in mind and not pile on people who are already struggling. <br /></p>

<p>Not to mention, afaik most chauvinists (straight cis male abusers and rapists in particular) would actually <i>agree</i> that “<i>yes, all men” -</i> that’s often the <i>whole twisted narrative.</i><i> </i>That they’re just enacting what everyone else is secretly unwilling to acknowledge.<br /></p>
