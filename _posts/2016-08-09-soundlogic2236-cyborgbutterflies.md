<p>Beware men who place a premium on sharing
 your feelings and thoughts – because that’s “communication” – but don’t
 share any of theirs.</p>
<p>Beware men who <a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2016/06/emotional-labor-womens-lives/">dump their emotions on you</a> and pretend that their “vulnerability” (in asking you to bear their burden) is a feminist act.</p>
