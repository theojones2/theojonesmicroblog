<p>Claims that the gender pay gap goes away after adjustment for variables (ie. working hours) can be dubious for a few reasons, 1) many of these variables can be outcome variables. In a world where the demand curve for labor is shifted due to discrimination, output (eg. working hours) may also directly decline, just using the adjustment tells us little about why the hours worked are lower, 2) some of the adjustment reports (particularly non-peer reviewed ones) have very large numbers of variables involved, you could get quite a bit of correlation between these variables just by random fluctuations in the data, 3) there can be broader social effects involved (although these issues donâ€™t make the problems with using the 70% number as an indicator go away, either way you need a model of <em>why</em> these effects happen). </p>
