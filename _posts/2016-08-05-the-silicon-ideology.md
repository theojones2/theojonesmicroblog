<p>I was linked this article (by someone who I won’t name unless they ask me to) and I think it’s very worth reading mainly for its very comprehensive discussion of the origins of NRx, and laying out pretty clearly what they actually believe. (I basically had things right I think, but it’s good to have it spelled out in detail).</p>
<p>It also has a look at past attempts to define and characterise fascism and presents its own like, diagnostic criteria, which is interesting but perhaps not as much as the sections on NRx etc.<br /></p>
<p>In terms of what those fuckers are actually about, this is probably short enough to excerpt:<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have discussed historical fascism at length. What then is neo-reaction? Neoreaction is a 21st century variant of fascism: a new ideology that values stability, order, efficiency, and “good governance” above all, or claims to. The actual beliefs of most neo-reactionaries are somewhat varied, but the core beliefs, as summed up by the neoreactionary Anissimov are (paraphrased): (1) a rejection of equality, (2) a commitment to right-wing politics, (3) a commitment to hierarchy, (4) a commitment to traditional sex roles, (5) a rejection of libertarianism, and (6) a rejection of democracy. Obviously, this is somewhat vague, and the commonalities do indeed go further than these six points.</p>
<p>Thus, here is a perhaps more comprehensive list of the backbone of neo-reactionary values:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><ol><li>Transhumanism and faith in the power of technology as a means towards other ends.</li>
<li>An authoritarian form of government. In more “moderate” or “reasonable” forms, this takes the form of running the country as a joint-stock corporation (this, for example, is Moldbug’s position), which is well within the norm of neoliberal thought. This, however, blends into calling for monarchy and aristocracy in more “extreme” variants (if we can classify them as “moderate” and “extreme”), with the ruler usually in either case being either a tech CEO (with several proposals being floated to make Eric Schmidt or Elon Musk or Peter Thiel “CEO of America”) or a super-intelligent machinic mind. The neo-reactionaries hope to be the aristocrats, or, sometimes, monarchs of their own in a patchwork of principalities somewhat reminiscent of the Holy Roman Empire.</li>
<li>The belief in a “Cathedral”, similar to the role ideology plays in Leftist theory, but one that pushes progressⅳe ends (feminism, multiculturalism, democracy, equality) – and a hostility towards this “Cathedral”</li>
<li>White (or, less frequently, East Asian, or, still less frequently, South Asian) nationalism, accompanied by scientific racism, eugenics, social Darwinism, degeneration theory, biological determinism, and a belief that ethnic uniformity increases social capital. Very frequently accompanied with anti-Semitism and the anti-Semitic canards of the early 20th century. Almost always accompanied with Islamophobia.</li>
<li>Faith in the Austrian School of Economics, or, less frequently, its more ’respectable’, less obviously astrological, cousin the Chicago School</li>
<li>Extreme misogyny based in evolutionary psychology, the active promotion of rape – stemming from this belief in traditional gender roles, extreme homophobia and transphobia</li>
<li>Cultural touchstones in war-based video games and tabletop games (such as the Imperium in Warhammer 40,000) along with “The Matrⅸ” (a movie, ironically, written and directed by two trans women partially about gender theory–one, in any case, that the NRx-ers have unfortunately clinged on to in bad readings)</li>
<li>Among the less academic, an obsession with cuckoldry and the use of mass harassment tactics (death threats, rape threats, DDoS, doxxing, swatting, misinformation campaigns &amp;c) to silence enemies</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There are two poles within neo-reaction, the “academic” pole, exemplified in LessWrong and the blogs of the main theorists of the movement (Unqualified Reservations, More Right, Outside In), and the “alt-right” pole, exemplified in 4chan (especially the /pol/ board), 8chan, My Posting Career, and The Right Stuff. The two poles meet on Reddit, Twitter, and Tumblr, among other sites. In addition, neo-reactionary ideas are quite common in Silicon Valley, though often without explicit allegiance to its theory, as can be seen in the statements of Peter Thiel and Balaji Srinivasan, among others.</p></blockquote>
<p>The historical section is much longer, and more interesting I think? It’s way too long to Excerpt but it rejects the ‘started with gamergate’ story and puts together a narrative out of a huge list of antecedents dating back to the 70s (though mostly from the 90s onwards). I think most of them <i>are</i> probably relevant but it’s kind of hard to see how they all added up to NRx from it? Still it’s a useful history of a huge proportion of the major influences in online culture, and points to the seeds of NRx in a lot of things that make sense to me.<br /></p>
<p>Given that the whole essay’s overtly from a leftist perspective, I don’t think it’s likely to be very persuasive to someone sympathetic to the alt-right, but I feel like it at least gives some idea of the beast we’re dealing with.</p>
<p>That said, I don’t find its proposals for fighting the alt-right particularly convincing though: it suggests using online tactics such as doxxing in addition to traditional antifa methods. This is the whole section on how to fight NRx:<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional anti-fascist tactics have largely been formulated in response to 20th century fascism. I am not confident that they will be sufficient to defeat neo-reactionaries.</p>
<p>That is not to say they will not be useful; merely insufficient. Neo-reactionaries must be fought on their own ground (the internet), and with their own tactics: doxⅺng especially, which has been shown to be effective at threatening the alt-right. Information must be spread about neo-reactionaries, such that they lose opportunities to accumulate capital and social capital. They must not be able to use social media without having to answer for their beliefs and actions.</p>
<p>A recent development we must pay attention to is the increase in no-shows by fascists when antifas learn about fascist rallies. This is a trend I’ve noticed (though, one which perhaps I’m misinterpreting) over the past year, and could have the dangerous effect of painting antifas as “the boy who cried wolf ”, and the use of liberal arguments (much like those used in the LamdbaConf debacle) to justify the inclusion of fascists who are less<br />open about the implications of their beliefs and less committed to wearing the iconography historically associated with their beliefs.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like it’s going to take a lot more than that? But I have no idea what and I’m scared. NRx has become so big and influential so quickly - it’s so horribly bizarre to see weird internet crap turning into an <i>actual fascist movement</i>.<br /></p>
<p>
(also on an incredibly minor note I find the style with all the ligatures on anything after the letter ‘t’, and old-school abbreviations 
like ‘&amp;c’, kind of weird and distracting, but not all that much)<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Not wholy endorsed, particularly the LW connection, but reposted for fun.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arrrrrrgh we’re not neoreactionaries! And the attempt to make us neoreactionaries makes this analysis a lot worse. Standard neoreactionary thought is not particularly transhumanist. And artificial general intelligence is not going to be king, it’s going to be God: the writings about the post-Singularity I’ve seen have generally been democratic or anarchist in terms of actual, like, governance. </p>
<p>Also, we’re all Jewish trans lesbians, the thesis that we’re homophobic transphobic misogynist anti-Semites… well, I guess it’s not <i>impossible</i>, people do believe many things that are harmful to their groups, but at the very least one should be suspicious of this claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Ozy, when we’re claiming to not be terrible cishet white men we’re obviously lying, because #notyourshield is a hashtag GamerGate people used! We’re definitely all evil fascists somehow and if antifa ever tries to crash a LW meeting we shouldn’t cancel it. Also, none of the eugenics-adjacent LW people have the disabilities they want less of, and none of the racist ones are black.</p>

<p>When I first saw this I noted the OP describing the article as a:</p>
<blockquote><p>very comprehensive discussion of the origins of NRx, and laying out pretty clearly what they actually believe. (I basically had things right I think, but it’s good to have it spelled out in detail).<br /></p></blockquote>
<p>Which combines with calling the people described “fuckers” a few sentences later made me pretty sure that this would be a validation of outgroup bashing, would fail any sort of ideological turing test, and would get so many things wrong. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where did this meme that the rationalist community is made up of a bunch of redpilled NRxers come from? There are a few idiots who vocally identify with both communities but they are generally disliked by the over-all rationalist community. </p></div>
