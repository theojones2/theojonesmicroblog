<p>This is in response to some libertarianish discussions that have shown up in my dash. Here are my problems with the Austrian School/NAPing variant of libertarianism.</p><p>1. It doesn’t really seem to grasp the existence of market failures and market concentration.</p><p>2. It doesn’t seem to have any conception of how private institutions can be effectively coercive. Pretty much the XKCD free speech cartoon argument applied to all of politics.</p><p>3. It has a weird conception of liberty that is put fullily in terms of property rights. </p><p>4. Transferring decision making to powerful private institutions does not <i>eliminate</i> the issues of governance it <i>moves</i> them. </p><p>5. It takes things like property rights as existing pretty much free floating, and not legal constructions. </p>
