<blockquote><p>Something strange is going on with the way we talk about feelings. Emotional responses are mocked in some but honored in others. The same people deride millennials and their “safe spaces” where feelings are never hurt, and then fall back on the refrain that “I just feel more secure when I have a gun.” Feelings, it seems, are either a laughable distraction or a crucial decision-making element, depending on who’s having them.</p>

<p>The need to feel safe, in particular, is often treated as childish and absurd—but only when coming from people who have actual reason to feel vulnerable. Asking to be recognized as your true gender? It’s all in your head. Asking for accommodations for illness and disability? You’re too sensitive. Recounting experiences of dehumanization because of your race or gender? What an overreaction. But those who want to make the country “safer” by securing the borders against people they perceive as outsiders are never painted as whiners or cowards. The police officers killing unarmed folks in a moment of panic are not mocked for failing to keep their feelings in check. When someone wants a deadly weapon, their desire to feel safe becomes a rugged and real and sexy conviction.</p></blockquote>

<p>The cognitive scientist inside me wants to force them to properly distinguish between mood, affect, feeling, emotion and sensory perception. Oh well…</p>

<p>Quoted article author is sort of doing the same thing, by treating the sort of fears of violent crime people address with gun ownership as mockable compared to fears that allowing a man to visit the feminist club will ruin everything. (Also, “they percieve as outsiders” is a weird phrase. If the quoted person doesn’t see extremely recent immigrants as outsiders, they should go live in some other country for a year. I will be shocked if they feel like an insider at any point during the year.)</p>

<p>The above is what I’m quoting. (Tumblr doesn’t seem to be handling the reblog formatting correctly. </p>

<p>This is where Ken White’s <a href="https://popehat.com/2015/11/09/safe-spaces-as-shield-safe-spaces-as-sword/">Safe Spaces As Shield, Safe Spaces As Sword </a>essay is relevant. Its fine if a community creates a zone for its beliefs and the types of people it wants.The problems with safe spaces come when the idea is used as a weapon against other groups, or as an excuse to cleanse non-political/mixed ideology of people who disagree with you. <br /></p></div>
