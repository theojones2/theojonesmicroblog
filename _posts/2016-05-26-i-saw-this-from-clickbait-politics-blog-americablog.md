<p>I saw this from clickbait politics blog AmericaBlog, “<em>Video shows Sanders-supporting chair thrower at Nevada Dem convention</em>“. Its objecting to Bernie supporters who are disrupting Democratic party events, and harassing Democrats. Normally, I wouldn’t share shitposts from sites like this. But the recommended post popup there was ironic. It was to this old post, “First thoughts on Mozilla’s anti-gay CEO resigning”. There is the issue. This type of clickbait site fed the toxic elements of the left when they were attacking members of the GOP, but are having second thoughts when their Frankenstein is now biting other Democrats. Remember, when you change norms of political discourse, you change them for everyone.  </p>
