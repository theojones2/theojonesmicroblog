<blockquote><p>“There’s a big difference between 2% and 30%, and this affects Scott’s 
argument.  There’s a tendency (which I sometimes fall into) of assuming

also the majority of the candidate’s supporters.”<br /></p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this ain’t just borderers. There are substantially more Irish Americans than Irish people in Ireland. In fact, there are tens of millions of mick and wop Americans with recent old world ancestry. They also just got online. Their kids have already decoupled from the more easily controlled forms of mass media. 1 in 35 Americans lives in NYC.</p>
<p>I know a lot of papists. They’re mostly voting for Trump (but my brother isn’t). There are various aspects of the priest rape scandal meme complex at work here (specifically the finer details that you can’t point out due to decorum and bigotry-accusation-avoidance constraints) but more broadly they seem to feel betrayed over various recent legal victories restricting their efforts to be fruitful and multiply. Also, Catholics seem more swayed by visual media (specifically with a social/human element) e.g. porn, YouTube, Jesus, frescos, etc.</p>
<p>But this isn’t happening because of Catholics or borderers. It’s happening because we finally convinced ourselves that classical media is the only real thing. The least real thing is the most real thing. Baudrillard. Pepe. So many depressed frogs these days, for various reasons.<br /></p>

<p>I thought the 2% vs 30% was because the argument was the base support comes specific population? Are Poor southerns a stand in for something else? What legal victories against the right to have children have their been recently? What is classical media? Who is the we that is convinced it is the most real thing. </p>

<p>Scott changed it from borderers to poor southern whites.</p>
<p>Not victories against the right to have children. Victories against the right to encourage reproduction at the group level by banning birth control and forcing gays to lead double lives.</p>
<p>Classical media is media that conveys information that is unconstrained by no-go theorems.</p>
<p>The we is everyone with internet access.<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are no-go theorems? With respect to birth control, ah yes the  existential negative externalities of social pollution.</p>
