<p>Now I’m not saying that anti Eastern European bigotry is a particularly pressing issue, and I’m aware this pales in comparison to the abuse Michelle Obama got and continues to get from people who disagree with her husband’s politics. </p>
<p>It’s just amazing to me how people who self identify as progressive think it’s absolutely justified and appropriate to be misogynist and xenophobic towards Melania Trump because her husband is misogynistic and xenophobic. </p>

<p>“Leaving everything you know and marrying a foreigner you’ve never met out of economic desperation is hilarious and you should be punished for it.” Jesus, this is gross. <br /></p>
