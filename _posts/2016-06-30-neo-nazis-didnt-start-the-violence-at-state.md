<p>Antifa started the violence. I actually guessed that after listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/EyrwB1xYups?t=37">this woman</a>: her manner is very defensive and self-justificatory.</p>
<p>Why I am not surprised? It’s obviously in the tactical interests of the “Traditionalist Worker Party” not to be violent, or at least, not to be the first to be violent, and I think these far-right groups have known that for awhile. What’s changed is that a much larger portion of the Left has abandoned the idea of civil society or of common rules in which politics and society should take place.</p>
<p>I mean, I’m against white nationalism, but ultimately I’m against violence (besides legitimate state violence according to law, because fuck anarchism). I don’t want white nationalists empowered, but ultimately more than that, I don’t want <i>anyone</i> empowered who meets political beliefs with violence, because that <i>always ends badly</i>, no matter who it is.<br /></p>
<p>Melissa Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_vgu4ewxVc">“needing some muscle”</a> to push a sympathetic journalist out of U.Missouri park space is another example. The campus is public (or university) space, other people had a right to be there, people don’t have the right to physically push them. Supposedly, we all understand these ground rules, and break them only deliberately. But the “muscle” wasn’t a deliberate act of civil disobedience, rather, <i>it hadn’t even occurred to her</i> or the activists that anyone else’s rights were more important that their protest. Unsurprisingly it eventually ended badly for her…</p>
<p>Back in the day protesters would <i>ridicule</i> the far right rather than attack and thereby justify them. It always seemed much more effective.</p>

<p>&gt;antifa in the United States</p>
<p>Dammit, they were supposed to stay in yurop.</p>

<p>California is occupied territory. Let’s see them try that in Arizona.<br /></p>

<p>The only places antifa can operate are ones where you can’t legally carry concealed firearms</p>
<p>If your MO is charging people and attacking them with bats, ie, giving people a clear-cut lawful excuse to shoot you in self-defense, you can only operate where your victims are disarmed</p>
<p>Apparently one of the guys they were attacking multiclassed into rogue though</p>
<p>You know what else is amazing about antifas? Unlike the left, the American right has been happy to engage in political events without violence or organizing platoons of street fighters, but if every right-wing protest is going to encounter antifas trying to violently no-platform them then they have no choice but to basically refound the blackshirts if they want to be able to engage in the political process</p>
<p>Antifas should probably call themselves ‘profas’ because they’re forcing the creation of fascists where there were none and giving actual justification to their existence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agree fully. This type of clash is going to leak into mainstream politics and mainstream political events are going to get targeted and its going to get ugly quickly. </p><p>I saw a (reasonably large center-left) blog defending the antifas on this issue use the “freedom of speech is just about the relation between the government and people” and the “freedom of speech isn’t freedom from consequences” one liners on this issue. Considering that those zingers have been used in regards to no platforming mainstream ideologies, its only a matter of time before the violent variant also targets someone mainstream. Not good. I don’t want a world where political disputes are resolved through street brawls. I like it when politics happens through the ballot box, not the ammo box. </p><p>When this is happening to skinheads its troublesome, but not terrifying. But what will be terrifying is when some of these clowns start to think that mainstream conservatives and libertarians need to be stopped “by all means necessary”. </p></div>
