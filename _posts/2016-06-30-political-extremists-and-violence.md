<p>Earlier this week in Sacramento <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/26/483619054/amid-violence-at-white-nationalist-rally-in-sacramento-at-least-7-hospitalized">attendees at a far-right white nationalist rally clashed with far-left counter protesters</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-1" id="enref-1016-1">1</a></sup> who used force to prevent the far-right rally from being held. From the facts as described by both the previously mentioned NPR article, and by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/26/us/brawl-at-california-rally/">CNN’s coverage of the issue</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-2" id="enref-1016-2">2</a></sup>, it sounds like the far-left counter-protesters initiated the violence and some of them went to the far-right event with the direct intent to disrupt it (as one internet posting before rally put it “by all means necessary”). Suppressing the actions of racist extremists (as long as they are not engaging in illegal activity) is probably a bad idea for various reasons. <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-3" id="enref-1016-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Since skinheads are not known for being the most peaceful types around, one argument for suppressing such groups involves the possibility that eliminating far-right groups could reduce the number of extremists who resort to violence. In this particular case it clearly did not, but we can ask more generally. A lot of countries vary in their tolerance for such extremists, with some countries banning them outright by legal force, and others (ie. the United States keeping them legal). If you believe that banning far right groups reduces violence, than the levels of hate crimes in countries that ban hate speech should be lower than in countries where it is legal. This translates pretty directly into evaluating the effectiveness of privately coordinated attempts to suppress these groups. However, this does not seem to be the case. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights keeps track of hate crime levels both in European Union members and some countries that are not E.U members (including the United States, Canada, and Switzerland). <a href="http://hatecrime.osce.org/">This dataset</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-4" id="enref-1016-4">4</a></sup> reports absolute numbers for crimes, but combined with population data <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)">from here</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-5" id="enref-1016-5">5</a></sup>, per capita levels of hate crimes can be compared. A quick look through of this data does not seem to indicate that banning extremest groups reduces violence. For instance <a href="http://hatecrime.osce.org/canada">Canada</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-6" id="enref-1016-6">6</a></sup> has a hate crimes rate that is 1.6 times that of the <a href="http://hatecrime.osce.org/united-states-america">United States</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-7" id="enref-1016-7">7</a></sup> — despite Canada’s hate speech laws. Over all <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Assaults">rates of violent crime</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-8" id="enref-1016-8">8</a></sup> are similar between the two countries, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate">over all rates of homicides</a> are higher in the the United States. </p>
<p>Indeed, I think there is a case to be made that suppressing far-right extremest groups from organizing could actually make them more violent. <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/">When religious cults undergo an event that reduces</a> <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-9" id="enref-1016-9">9</a></sup> their membership, the most moderate members the first to leave, and the remaining members become even more extreme. This is because the relatively moderate members of the cult moderate the other members and reduce the over-all extremism level in the group. The presence of the relatively moderate members of the cult create social pressure against being too fanatical. I suppose that the same effect exists with political extremists. With political extremism, fanaticism correlates with violent tendencies. Suppressing extremist groups increases the costs of joining the group, and this will remove moderate members from the extremest group increasing violence. This means that suppressing   <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-10" id="enref-1016-10">10</a></sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-11" id="enref-1016-11">11</a></sup> Additionally, forcing extremest groups underground may make their workings less known, and thus make them harder to defeat, and it may reinforce their conspiracy view of the world.  </p>
<p>Since the above is pretty rough and cursory, I tried to find an academic analysis of the effectiveness of hate speech laws. As far as I have been able to find, there aren’t really empirical studies on the subject.  If any one reading this does know of empirical studies that look into the extent to which laws banning hate speech reduce the number of hate crimes that occur, bring them up in the comments. I’ve found theoretical research on this subject,but nothing empirical. And I found studies indicating that the presence of bigoted attitudes in the population increases the number of crimes, but not that much on laws banning the expression of these attitudes (I know that the last sentence to an extent contradicts my point, but not too much). I am open to hearing papers that contradict my views express here . </p>
<p>Other than ineffectiveness, one should be against this type of method, because it will hit other people than the far-right.  </p>
<p>This type of clash is going to leak into mainstream politics and mainstream political events are going to get targeted and its going to get ugly quickly. </p>
<p>I saw a (reasonably large center-left) blog defending the counter protesters on this issue use the “freedom of speech is just about the relation between the government and people” and the “freedom of speech isn’t freedom from consequences” one liners on this issue <sup class="endnote"><a href="https://theojones.name/2016/06/political-extremists-and-violence/#en-1016-12" id="enref-1016-12">12</a></sup>. Considering that those zingers have been used in regards to no platforming mainstream ideologies, its only a matter of time before the violent variant also targets someone mainstream. Not good. I don’t want a world where political disputes are resolved through street brawls. I like it when politics happens through the ballot box, not the ammo box. </p>
<p>When this is happening to skinheads its troublesome, but not terrifying. But what will be terrifying is when some of these clowns start to think that mainstream conservatives and libertarians need to be stopped “by all means necessary”. </p>
