<p>The extremist turn in U.S politics (exemplified on the right by Donald Trump) is probably driven by a relatively small part of the U.S population. This small part of the population is amplified by its ability to throw weight around in a subsets of the political system where small, but highly participatory segments of the populace have disproportionate impact (in the case of Trump, this is the Primary system).<br />
Here is a good article on the level of support that Trump actually has </p>

<p>The above article estimates that Trump is the top choice for president of as low as 7% of the voting population. And possibly less of the over-all population.  Trump has little actual support. But it is well positioned, and highly energized. </p>
<p>This is different from what is going on in Europe where extremists are straight up winning pluralities in elections.</p>
