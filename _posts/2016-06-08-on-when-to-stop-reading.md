<p>Tyler Cowen a while ago wrote a post titled “<a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/05/when-can-you-stop-reading.html">When can you stop reading?</a>” <sup class="endnote"><a href="#en--1" id="enref--1">1</a></sup>, which asks, what are the signals that you are reading something that is very low quality. Here are a few of my signals.</p>
<ol><li>Ideological insults that just serve as a pejorative of the other side. The ones of this form mentioned in the link include “bankster” and “feminazi”. Other additions that I would suggest would include terms like SJW, and cuck. Variations of the name of an individual or group also apply here (Obummer, Drumpf)</li>
<li>Cites a well-known crank source, or crank. This includes sites like WattsUp, NaturalNews, and InfoWars.</li>
<li>Engages in “nutpicking” ie. taking an extreme totally fringe viewpoint and taking it as if it is a mainstream representative of a viewpoint.</li>
<li>Conspiracy theories of various kinds.</li>
<li>Calling people shills.</li>
<li>Anything that is phrased as to be intentionally misleading. This includes arguments that are mostly mucking around with definitions, and blatant use of logical fallacies.</li>
</ol>
