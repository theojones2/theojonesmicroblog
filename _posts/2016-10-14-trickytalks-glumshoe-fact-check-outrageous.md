<p>Fact-check outrageous claims. <b>Even the ones that support your ideologies. </b>Donald Trump is an evil person, but don’t go spreading photoshopped pictures of him in Klan robes thinking they’re real. Falling for hoaxes and spreading myths only weakens your credibility and wastes other people’s times.</p>
<p>On the bright side, I have learned a whole heck of a lot about the <a href="http://archive.archaeology.org/9701/newsbriefs/syphilis.html">history of syphilis</a> ‘cause you all think Columbus fucked a llama. </p>

<p>Also, do a lot of reading generally about topics relevant to your ideologies! Otherwise you won’t be well-calibrated towards identifying <i>which</i> claims are outrageous, versus the ones that are merely weird.</p>
