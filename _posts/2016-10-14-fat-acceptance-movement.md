<blockquote><p>I wish the fat acceptance movement wouldn’t push the narrative of “fat is healthy, so be nice to fat people!”  I wish they could just content themselves with “be nice to fat people.”</p><p>Because:</p><p>1. Most people who are shits to fat people aren’t really doing it because of health concerns.  Someone who oinks at fat women in the street is not under the serious impression that he’s doing a public health service.</p><p>2. You might be proven wrong.  I don’t want to say “there’s no link between weight and health” on political grounds as if it’s a scientific fact.  The truth is that the connections between weight and health are <i>really complicated</i>, and while it is true they’re not as simple as “fat is bad for you, QED”, they’re not as simple as “fat has zero effect on your body, QED” either.</p><p>If studies comes out proving that really is just 100% awful for your health, I don’t want that to also disprove the statement “fat people shouldn’t hate themselves.”  These two things shouldn’t be dependent on each other.</p><p>3. Some people <i>aren’t </i>healthy.  Do they have less right to body acceptance?  Should they be rightly ashamed of the things that made them unhealthy?</p><p>So yeah.  Let’s be nice to fat people, and be nice to our own bodies, without making it a question of health.</p></blockquote><p></p>
