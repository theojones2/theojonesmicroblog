<h2><b><i>INTRODUCING: THE PRISONER’S TROLLEY PROBLEMMA</i></b></h2>
<p>A trolley full of your loved ones is heading down the tracks and will hit another loved one. If you redirect it, it will hit three strangers, but all of your loved ones will be fine. However, there is another person on the other side of the tracks facing the same problem. If you both choose to redirect the trolleys, they will crash in the middle, killing almost everyone. </p>
<p>The least amount of people will die if you do nothing and allow a loved one to die, the best-case scenario for you will occur if you pull your lever and the other person does not pull theirs, and the worst-case scenario will occur if you <i>both</i> pull your levers.</p>
<p>What do you do???</p>

<p>See this is that game theory shit that I love! Assuming that the two Levermen must make their decisions <b>simultaneously with no chance for negotiation</b>, they will both pull the lever if they both hold the view that they would rather have three strangers die rather than a loved one. The Nash Equilibrium in the outcome is that both trolleys will collide. Here’s that decision in normal form. I will assign each loved one loss a -2 while a stranger killed is a -0.5. The strangers deaths subtract from both players outcomes.</p>

<p>If both players have the preferences state above, they both see incentive to switch, however if they both do, the worst possible outcome occurs. <br /></p>
<p>This situation is no different than the standard prisoner dilemma other than how difficult it may be to determine other players’ preferences. </p>
<p>I can’t accurately determine the most likely outcome but you can take a poll here, and I’ll publish my results</p>
<p><b>Poll:<a href="https://goo.gl/tWg6xl"> https://goo.gl/tWg6xl</a></b><br /></p>
<p>To overcome this each player must understand the incentives of all other players in the game. The maximum possible outcome is not always the best choice as other players also seek to maximize their utility. With this in mind coordination with other players yields rewards that are far greater than what would otherwise occur without cooperation. Of course this is only realized in the most motivating of all rewards…<br /></p>

<p><b>WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG</b></p>
<p>THAT IS NOT A NASH EQUILIBRIUM!</p>
<p>THEY DO NOT HAVE INCENTIVE TO SWITCH IF THEY THINK THE OTHER PERSON IS SWITCHING.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A PRISONERS’ DILEMMA!</p>
<p>WHY DO PEOPLE NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT A PRISONER’S DILEMMA IS???</p>
<p>A PRISONER’S DILEMMA CANNOT BE SOLVED PURELY BY EASY COMMUNICATION, THE WAY THIS CAN BE</p>
<p>100% DEFECT IS NOT THE NASH EQUILIBRIUM HERE!!</p>
<p>IN FACT, IT’S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING THE EQUILIBRIUM</p>
<p>THE EQUILIBRIUM IS MUCH CLOSER TO 100% “COOPERATE”, BECAUSE THE COST OF A DOUBLE-DEFECT IS SO HIGH</p>

<p>Exactly. Solving the game (using the payoff table in libertybill’s post) with the method of oddments indicates that the optimal mixed strategy is to stay with 95.23% probability. </p>
