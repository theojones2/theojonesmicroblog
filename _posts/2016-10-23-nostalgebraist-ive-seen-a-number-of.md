<blockquote>
<p>I’ve seen a number of news/opinion pieces about the fact that Peter Thiel donated a very large sum of money to Trump, in connection with his involvement in various Silicon Valley companies.  E.g. people saying that Y Combinator should either fire him from his advisory position, or issue some sort of statement saying that it doesn’t endorse his views.</p>
<p>I am really confused by this.  Peter Thiel is a rich guy who supports Trump.  A large fraction of U.S. citizens support Trump.  If you interact with any big U.S.-based company whatsoever, it’s likely that there are rich Trump supporters involved with that company, who have a lot of influence over what it does.  Some of them may be big donors to Trump, even.  So why is it specifically a big deal when it comes to Thiel and these tech companies?  Or, if it’s a big deal everywhere it happens, why is this the first case where I’ve seen it treated like a big deal in the news?</p>
<p>I feel like I am actually missing something here.  Can someone explain?</p>

<p>IDK too much about the details here other than reading Scott Aaronson’s post on it, but I would guess that people want to collect his scalp because </p><p>1. Thiel gave a speech at the RNC so his scalp is a visible one  </p><p>2. The tech community is sufficiently anti-trump that, unlike in other industries, you can advocate for people like him to be ejected without getting laughed out of the room. Elsewhere, conservatives have non-trivial representation in the industry, so , issues like what you mention in your second paragraph become overriding. </p><p>3. There is a lot of outside pressure on the tech industry on the issue of sexism/racism. </p>
