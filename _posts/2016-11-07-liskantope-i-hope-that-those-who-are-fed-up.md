<p>I hope that those who are fed up with recent SJ culture aren’t using this as an reason to vote for Trump [1].  To them I would like to point out two things.</p>
<p>First of all, as Scott Alexander recently <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/28/ssc-endorses-clinton-johnson-or-stein/">more or less pointed out</a>, Trump’s election would only cause further polarization between those who are part of the SJ subculture and those who are skeptical or decidedly against it.  SJ rhetoric would only become more obnoxiously militant, and I’m willing to bet that anti-SJ rhetoric isn’t going to get any nicer or more constructive either.  In my opinion, nobody wins when our society’s subcultures become more polarized.</p>
<p>Secondly, Donald Trump and his campaign have absolutely epitomized at least a couple of the traits which are widely considered by critics to be characteristic of SJ culture.  One is a blatant victimhood mentality: supposedly, everything is always rigged against Trump and he is constantly being viewed through the lens of some double standard.  Another is a complete disregard for accuracy in favor of issuing the most outrageous statements possible as long as they indicate whose side he’s on.  This is basically a steroid-induced version of the “arguments are soldiers” mentality that SJ-oriented people like Arthur Chu have been known to champion.  Unless you want to see a lot more intellectually dishonest SJ-style tactics in the political mainstream, just defending different object positions, I don’t think that you’ll enjoy the rhetorical ambiance under a Trump administration.  Oh, and thirdly, for those who believe that SJers act too much like bullies, well…<br /></p>
<p>I’m not vagueblogging here, as I don’t get the impression that this applies to anyone I interact with here.  But who knows who else might stumble upon this post, and I might as well put it out there.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>[1] unless they are directly opposed to basic object-level SJ beliefs, in which case we have other issues<br /></p>
