<blockquote><p>I can’t find the post but somewhere on here I responded to a video or gifset of John Oliver when he created that lazy meme. Here are the bullet points:</p><ol><li><b>It’s not funny. </b>(I know that doesn’t matter to Oliver or his followers but he claims to be a comedian and his show is allegedly a comedy show) Just because a surname isn’t Anglican doesn’t automatically make it funny.<br /></li><li><b><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/us/politics/donald-drumpf-a-funny-label-but-is-it-fair.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">It’s not accurate.</a></b> Donald Trump was <i>never</i> “Drumpf”. His father was never “Drumpf”. His grandfather was never anything other than Trump, and and nobody in his family tree has had any connection to the name “Drumpf” in over 400 years<br /></li><li><b><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/03/03/john-olivers-donald-drumpf-jokes-play-on-the-same-ugly-xenophobia-trump-does/">It’s xenophobia and it’s name-calling</a></b> (which are things that, once again, Trump is denounced for by the same people who traffic in this shit themselves against him and other favored targets) <br /></li></ol></blockquote><p>I think you’re missing some important context here. Trump got into a Twitter argument with Jon Stewart in 2013 because Stewart had called him ‘Fuckface von Clownstick,’ and Trump made some comment about how Stewart wasn’t proud of his heritage because he didn’t use his real last name, and then insisted on calling him Jon Leibowitz, which a lot of people took as anti-Semitic and got upset about. Calling him Drumpf is a direct response to that incident - ‘be proud of your heritage, use your real last name - Drumpf.’</p></blockquote>
