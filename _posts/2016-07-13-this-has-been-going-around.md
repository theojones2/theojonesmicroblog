<p>This has been going around</p><p><a href="https://storify.com/ZJemptv/medium-com-jencoates">https://storify.com/ZJemptv/medium-com-jencoates</a></p><p>

Its a response (by Zinnia Jones) to an essay written by Jennifer Coates 
about her experiences as a Transwoman. There are a lot of problems with Zinnia Jones’ response, but lets focus on this gem:
<br /></p><blockquote><p><i>I don’t know if this person has considered there are emotional and, yes, financial repercussions to dysphoria she maybe can’t afford</i></p><p><i><br />Disability-adjusted life years are a thing. They’ve been calculated for the impact and burden of depression.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a really dangerous misuse of QUALY metrics. Such metrics are a way for public health policy makers (ie. governments, insurance companies, and NGOs) to decide on how to allocate funding. They are not the only (or in many cases even the primary) metric one should use in deciding which treatments to use. If Jennifer Coates decided to transition, QUALY metrics are the type of thing that her insurance company should use to decide on if to fund the related medical treatments (and there is very strong evidence to suggest that insurance companies should fund such services).</p><p>But cost effectiveness is not the only relevant attribute here. Sideffects, and other downsides of the medical treatments (and of the transition process as a whole) are also very relevant here. And in the case of Coates probably the overriding factor in her decision.</p>
