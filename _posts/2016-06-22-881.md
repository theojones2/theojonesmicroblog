<p>When behind NGINX and using ssl wordpress can have issues with providing the ssl url for static content. This type of issue can be resolved by adding the following to the wp-config.php file </p>
<p><code>define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);<br />
// in some setups HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO might contain<br />
// a comma-separated list e.g. http,https<br />
// so check for https existence<br />
if (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'], 'https') !== false)<br />
       $_SERVER['HTTPS']='on';<br /></code></p>
